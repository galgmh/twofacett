It had not trembled in the days since the people chose him as their Champion. \" Perhaps the Dragon slumbers yet, \" he thought. \" I shall wake him, soon enough. \" He strode forward, heavily, in his iron raiment, shining dully in the morning sun. The shrouded peak drew slowly nearer as the sun climbed the sky, mirroring the Warrior' s toil this day as the last. The Dragon slept silently in its lair amidst the clouds. For generations the people had not seen it wake. But their stories, told by night and hearth fire, still remained hushed in reverence of its deadly wrath. Legends told of it waking and the destruction that followed. But that was before. Before the people had tamed iron and bent it to their will. Now they had weapons that could fight the myth. That could quench the fire. The Warrior stopped at the edge of the cloud bank, just as the sun had stopped there hours before. He breathed. Deliberately he pulled the heavy iron axe from his belt and gripped it between strong hands. A glow had appeared within the clouds. The mountain rumbled. \" I have come to wake you, beast, and I have come to show you the people no longer fear you. \" The ground rolled and thundered. He roared in defiance and raised his axe, charging into the fog. He half ran and climbed in muffled beats as his bloodlust for the Dragon pounded in his ears. The glow grew brighter and the ground shook violently. A gout of flame split the clouds in front of the Warrior and he saw his destination. The rock ended in a ridge just above him and the Dragons flames beat and splashed beyond. Without breaking stride, the iron Warrior crested the ridge and leapt, axe raised high, into a pit of Dragon fire.",

Each step was deliberate, echoing the weight of his mission. The summit, shrouded in a delicate veil of clouds, called to him as the sun rose higher, mirroring his relentless ascent. For generations untold, the Dragon had rested in its hidden lair, cloaked in mist, its existence a mere whisper among the flickering flames of campfires. These tales, filled with both reverence and dread, spoke of the creature’s catastrophic fury and the destruction that would follow its awakening.\n\nBut those were ancient days, long before the people forged iron into weapons, bending the metal to their will.

He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.",
        "llm_text_1": "I had previously been a patient of Dr. Johnson until he left, at which point I was assigned to Dr. Goldberg. Unfortunately, my experience with him has been quite disappointing. It seems that Dr. Goldberg is more concerned with the financial aspects of his practice than with the actual health and well-being of his patients. I've observed that he prioritizes collecting co-pays over providing meaningful care to those who depend on him.\n\nOne particularly frustrating aspect of his practice is the requirement for in-person visits every month just to approve medication refills. This policy is incredibly aggravating, as it shows a blatant disregard for the financial strain it places on patients. Managing 90-day mail order prescriptions through his office has also turned into a significant hassle. The entire process is fraught with challenges, and I often feel as though I’m hitting a brick wall when trying to obtain the medications I need.\n\nCompounding these issues is the incompetence of the office staff, which only heightens my frustration. I frequently find that when I call, my calls go directly to voicemail, and it’s exceedingly rare for anyone to return my calls. This breakdown in communication makes an already stressful situation even harder to navigate.\n\nThe impact of this poor service isn’t just limited to me; my family is feeling the strain as well. Both of my adult children and my husband have reached their limits and opted to leave this practice due to the overwhelming frustration we’ve all experienced. The attitude of the office staff is also quite off-putting; they often behave as though they are doing patients a favor by simply being present. It’s disheartening to feel like just another statistic when all I want is genuine care and attention.\n\nI firmly believe that patients deserve much better treatment than what we are currently receiving at this practice. If you’re considering this office for your healthcare needs, I strongly advise you to think twice. You deserve a physician who prioritizes your health and well-being above all else, rather than one who is solely focused on financial gain. I have never felt compelled to write a negative review for anyone before, but my experience with Dr. Goldberg has prompted me to share my thoughts. His clear emphasis on profit over quality healthcare is alarming. Spare yourself the trouble and seek out a different doctor who will truly prioritize your needs and deliver the care you rightfully deserve.",
        "llm_text_2": "Having been a patient of Dr. Johnson until his departure, I was reassigned to Dr. Goldberg, and unfortunately, my experience has been quite disappointing. It seems that Dr. Goldberg prioritizes the financial aspects of his practice over the health and well-being of his patients. I've observed that he often focuses on collecting co-pays rather than providing the meaningful care we truly need.\n\nOne of the most frustrating elements of his practice is the requirement to attend in-person appointments every month just to obtain medication refills. This policy is not only frustrating but also shows a clear disregard for the financial strain it places on patients. Furthermore, managing 90-day mail-order prescriptions through his office has become a significant inconvenience. The entire process is fraught with challenges, and I frequently feel as though I'm hitting a brick wall when trying to access the medications I depend on.\n\nTo make matters worse, the inefficiency of the office staff only heightens my frustration. When I call, my calls often go straight to voicemail, and it’s exceedingly rare for anyone to return them. This breakdown in communication adds to an already stressful experience.\n\nThe consequences of this inadequate service extend beyond just my situation; my family has also been affected. Both of my adult children and my husband have reached their breaking point and decided to leave this practice due to the overwhelming frustration we’ve all encountered. The attitude of the office staff is far from welcoming; they often behave as if they are doing patients a favor merely by being present. It’s disheartening to feel like just another number when all I seek is genuine care and attention.\n\nI truly believe that patients deserve far better treatment than what we are currently receiving at this practice. If you are considering this office for your healthcare needs, I strongly encourage you to think twice. You deserve a physician who prioritizes your health and well-being above all else, rather than one whose primary concern appears to be financial gain. I have never felt compelled to write a negative review until now, but my experience with Dr. Goldberg has driven me to share my thoughts. His evident prioritization of profit over quality healthcare is deeply concerning. Spare yourself the hassle and seek out a different doctor who will genuinely prioritize your needs and provide the care you rightfully deserve.",
