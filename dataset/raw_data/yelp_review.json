No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \"they were out\".

Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said, \"Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you! \" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough. nnThere are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on! nnI'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore.

What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \"Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll. \" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says.

Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu! nnNot only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. nnI am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either.

I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer. I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.

I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2, 000 calories in one sitting.

Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it?? ? nnAdditionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had. n nOn a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done. nnFinal verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough.

The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked. If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all!

First, they switched the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct Iggle video was. That's A-ok with me, I didn't use the pharmacy anyway. nnBut THEN, THEN they moved the whole toiletries section over there. They put my spaghetti and \"ethnic food\" section (by the way, I love that ethnic food includes spaghetti) to where my Tylenol was. My kitty food is now where my spaghetti once was. Can you tell how exasperated I'm getting?? nnDid I mention I don't mind change? But here's the thing, I really hate grocery shopping. It's kinda sorta my own fault because I must read every label to make sure I'm not eating something with 25 grams of fat and 5000 calories (even though ice cream may go into my cart from time to time. ) So going to this Giant Eagle frequently was nice because I KNEW WERE EVERYTHING WAS. Now I don't.. .. wahhh! nnOk, I'll stop crying. I know I'll eventually be back. I'm sure (?? ) it will be an even better more magical grocery shopping experience once they're done.

Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain. You should know that going into any chain, really. It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price. nnWe were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of. Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled. I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food. nnMy fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items. It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it. I had the potato skin appetizer. It reminds me of a \"baked potato pizza\" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo. It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce. nnOverall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original? It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago.",

Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. nnNow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for. nnBottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are.

Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks. nnLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us.

(not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died. nnObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant.

The service is decent, kind of point blank, not rude, nor over the top friendly. nnThe crowd can fluctuate between 'Oh my god, I'm surrounded by Hillbillies' to 'the local gathering at Mayberry', but that seems to be the norm for most places in da burgh. nnI've not had the pizza, which apparently get raves, because frankly I only think of pizza as coming in a box to my front door when I'm too lazy to do any cooking at home.

I was in a good mood though, so the attitude over the phone didn't bother me. Price was good, typical takeout rates. The good news is that they will allow you to pay with credit cards over the phone, so if you're like me and never carry cash, you can still get delivery. She told me 45 minutes for the food. nnThe food arrived in about 20 minutes (we live half a mile away), it was hot and smelled great. Hubby's Mei Fun looked typical, but he was saddened to see that they didn't exchange the white sauce for brown sauce. The beef was pretty mushy, and didn't taste all that great. The veggies were fresh, and pretty crispy even after soaking in sauce. Noodles were alright, nothing to write home about. My General Tso tofu was delicious, and tasted exactly like the dish I was craving. Fried to perfection, perfect-sized pieces of tofu, and a fantastic sauce. The broccoli was fresh and tasted good. This particular dish only came in one size: Enormous. I think hubby and I just ended up sharing my meal, paired with some mediocre egg rolls. nnSo, long story short, lady on the phone was a bit irritating, delivery was fast, food was fresh, and, depending on what you order, the food quality ranges from so-so to great.

The racks are packed with clothes - and I mean, hard to move the hangers because there is so much stock, which can be a pro or a con depending on how you like it. I found it a bit cumbersome since although the clothes are organized by type (dress vs. blouse) there is NO size separation. In a place this huge, it takes quite a long time to find what you're looking for without the size separation. But, I'm not one to abandon a bargain because I don't want to look around (after all, that is what its all about), so I gave a good 30 min-45 and got a handful of garments to try on. (I would typically spend a few hours, but I was trying to spare a friend not as keen on secondhand garments). With my carefully extracted finds I searched in vain for a fitting room, never to find one. After asking the staff where it was, I had to take a seat and leave my jaw dropped for a while because THERE IS NO FITTING ROOM! nI couldn't take this fact into my brain, and although there were some household items I wanted to go back and buy, I was too upset to continue. (Sidenote: yes, I can understand how this can work for the RWB, but imho it is unforgivable, and I wish there was at least some warning before spending my time searching for a bargain when I couldn't even see if it would fit). nnI would recommend this store if you are looking for something specific secondhand especially for dishes, or older electronics, or even beauty products. There was even a used Nikon SLR with a wide angle lens ($200 though)! nBut if you plan on buying a sundress, and don't plan on stripping down in front of your fellow thrifties, you'd better be confident in your purchase.

For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples. Upon receiving the salad I dug in. The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad. However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.

I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.

Because it is Labor Day weekend, the place was empty except for a woman who had just gotten there too which was nice because a friend had warned me that the place gets crazy. We sat outside and atmosphere was cozy under the tent with the warm colors of the decor. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and presented us with the menus. I think it is great they have a prix fixe brunch - 1 alchy or nonalchy drink, an appetizer and an entree - but for $24. It looks like they have since raised the prices since Miles O. went. I felt it was just a tad steep and a lot of food but took the plunge anyway. I ordered the smoked salmon for the appetizer and the mushroom omlette for my entree, and had a hot coffee (they did not have ice coffee though offered to put ice with hot coffee if I wanted it). The waitress brought out some delicious mini baked treats before we got our dishes - poppy scone (on the crispier side but delicious), blueberry muffins and biscuits, which were all buttery goodness. After eating these I was getting a little full and then after my appetizer I realized I probably should not have gotten the prix fixe but could have would have should have. I ended up boxing half of my omlette entree. Portions were large, atmosphere was cool, food was good and wait staff were awesome but in the end I don't think $24 (not including the tip and tax) was worth it.",

The pasta was a little too creamy for me and just didn't have enough seasoning or spice. I did love the addition of the cranberries in it though. The perfect amount of sweet to offset the cream. The roast turkey sandwich was just that. Not out of this world, but not bad. My biggest complaint was the service.

I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish. Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless.

Even a small crack with a few problems set on it. nnIt seems like whoever is in charge of setting the boulder problems really has some talent. I might be back to bolder once in a blue moon. The other climbers here were pretty cool, so the place might have a good vibe/community aspect. nnnNow the downsides. The staff wasn't very helpful. The rules regarding the top rope area are nonsensical, and the only reasoning offered up was insurance. I wanted to belay for a friend, but he wasn't allowed in the top rope area unless belay tested. Belay testing also cost $5, and I hate when gyms charge for a test. It's poor form. nnThe ropes aren't doubled up, and with the short wall it gives way too much pull. They require you to clip into daisy chains on the ground. I wanted to lead climb, but there was no one at the gym that could give a lead test. The TR routes were really hit or miss, a lot of them just confusing and not fun. They aren't rated properly, just easy, medium, or hard. nnThe walls are painted plywood, so smearing is basically impossible. Further, I question if the holds have ever been cleaned. Some of them are so polished to the point that it's dangerous. nnThere's only once changing room, and overall the place isn't very clean.

Because Marshall was running late (20 minutes and counting) Caesar cut my hair this time. Another great cut! nnAgain, however, the desk needs training in customer service. After a 20 minute wait, the receptionist still hadn't notified Marshall that I was there. A downtown salon depends on clients who are on their lunch hours for the most part. Next appointment I'll call ahead to see how they're running before heading to the salon and waiting. nnEmilio IS working on the front desk situation.

A dark-haired guy greeted me as I walked in and treated me like a total noob, and his demeanor made me feel like the dirt under his shoes. However, he did give me good information and service about my camera when prompted by another man in the shop (who I might assume is Bernie). nnThey told me they could send it to the manufacturer where they'd clean it for a couple hundred bucks, but instead they cleaned out the sensors and the lens right there at the counter and checked the contacts between the lens and the camera. The dark-haired guy showed me through a magnifying glass what I was looking at, and explained that some spots I saw in the viewfinder were inside the top of the camera and wouldn't appear on the pictures. The other guy (Bernie? ) explained to me some of the functions of the camera -- I knew these already, but it was nice to hear them explained and he showed me a few examples. They advised me to get a UV filter to protect my lens, which I knew was overpriced but I happily bought anyway to pay for their service. nnSo I think the kind of experience you get depends entirely on the person you run into. I can see how someone would be put off by the dark haired guy I ran into first, and how someone would absolutely love the service from the other guy.

In addition to the friendliness of the staff and shuttle service to the stadium, the continental breakfast that was provided was pleasantly surprising in that in addition to the typical fare (cereal, muffins, danish, hard boiled eggs, coffee, etc. ), there was a generous selection of meats, cheeses, and fruits.

There was one film about migration in the modern art room which we both really enjoyed. I found the art involving the venetian blinds and various types of light bulbs to be fascinating.

Although that shop was owned by Satan and made his customers do unspeakable things to each other, this is far from that. But you do get the feeling here that we are not alone and there are other realms to our world. Books galore on the occult, spirit worlds, shadow people, how to rid your home of evil spirits and I just wish she wasn't closing the store when I was walking in.

This lot is the one that fills up super quickly, creates miniature traffic jams like no one's business, and is a time-stealing trap. Sigh.

Now, while I've never left the shop empty handed and I LOVE browsing the fantastic and varied beer selection here, I have admittedly had trouble finding specific favorite beverages of mine, such as flavors of Magner or even varieties of Blue Moon. But I think this has more to do with my taste (remember, not the biggest beer person, more of a cider/wine person) than the shop itself - you can always at least find the basic ciders and beers here. And again, I've never left empty handed despite my snobby tastes: usually I leave with a whole case of Woodchuck, and most recently a whole case of Fall Woodchuck. Yum! Also, the men behind the desk are usually pretty good about asking if you need a hand taking things to your car. (Usually. )nnStill, the parking situation here keeps me from giving the place 4 stars. Getting into the lot here can be a little frightening as you hope the person behind you is paying attention and slowing down while you turn into the lot. The lot itself is pretty tiny so problems can arise if too many people stop in for beer at once. Finally, getting out is even more terrifying than pulling in, because no one slows down on Banksville, ever, to let you out. Be prepared to sit for a few minutes if traffic is heavy. nnHappy shopping, beer lovers!",

The tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts. The California grilled salad. The chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos. Nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent. Their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas). Basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine. nnAdditionally, some of their entrees are available with your choice of either chicken, steak, shrimp, portobello mushrooms or tofu. They have tons of vegetarian options. They have good happy hour deals and good late night margarita deals. They have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers. nnSo basically: the less you know about Mexican food, the less disappointed you will be.

I hate it when they do this, I guess its just their way of being cheap and not taking out a new nail polish. The end result is that there are bubbles now on my nails and less than 24 hours later I just noticed that one of my nails has already chipped.

I tried these nachos which were good and interesting because it had a decent quality sausage as the meat and not just ground beef. I also really liked the sweet potato fries. They were delicious and you usually can't get these at too many places. I ordered the lobster roll. It was a ton of lobster, however some of the lobster was a little overcooked and it was ice cold. I can understand serving cool even though Id prefer warm, but ice cold really wasn't that good when they put warm butter on it. I also tried the tortilla soup, which was really rich and had a good spicy flavor. The only thing missing in the tortilla soup was the tortilla chips. A minor oversight I imagine. Overall, a pretty decent place when you are looking to just have a few beers with friends. I've also tried the upstairs bar which is the more upscale section. The bar is huge which is good plenty of room, and their is plenty of seating including leather couches. The happy hour is okay, but it's pretty much a ghosttown after 8 PM. Overall a decent place for quiet drinks without the crowds and a little better than average food.",

I moved up here from Orlando to be with my boyfriend who I had just started dating. I moved because Orlando on a whole sucks and I was ready to get out. My boyfriend used to play in a band as does one of his best friends now. This was their favorite spot to hang out out because all of the (female) bartenders know and love them. They used to get free or greatly reduced drinks, could be as loud and obnoxious as they wanted, etc. etc. - the ush. nnI tag along now because I didn't know many people in this city at first, obviously. The bar is way too small for the number of people who try to pack in at night. I've had several items off of the menu and they all left a lot to be desired. The drinks are poured strongly. At first I thought this was because the bartenders knew how the boys liked their drinks, but now I realize they're just heavy handed. nnNothing here really sticks out for me. I can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price. Same with the food. I guess the only reason I agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - Amy and Linda. Those two are the most kick ass bartenders in Pittsburgh. Considering I currently live in Heinz, it's also pretty damn close, which works in its favor (can't wait to move. .. ). nnOlive or Twist has a great location and, if Amy and/or Linda are working, you're sure to enjoy yourself.

I didn't have a martini, however there was a few options on the drink menu.

Given the fact that it wasn't busy, it did take a long time to arrive. When it did, it looked OK. The fruit salad looked as if it was ready for the trash, so I bypassed that.

And to that I say.. . \"who cares\". I personally didn't care for the fries and slaw inside my sandwich, but I am also not a huge french fry or cole slaw fan. (I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average, ) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. nnThe ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients. nnOn the plus side, the sandwiches average about $7 each, and for that price, your get a pretty decent sandwich.

The salad that came with the mixed grille was decent in flavor but did have some brown old lettuce in it. As for the cold combination, the tzatziki, one grape leaf, and hummus were fine but the tarmasalata had some ingredient which was clearly spoiled. The cru00e8me caramel (greek version of flan) was floating in water, really strange texture; my guess is it was frozen then defrosted, but a dessert should absolutely not be floating in a large pool of water.",

My stepson and I were on our own for dinner so made sense to go out for the evening. So I picked this place knowing it was a kid friendly joint and not chili's or fuddruckers etc. The building itself is great. I loved the feeling of going into this renovated looking warehouse. He thought it was cool as well. The best part was inside. the decor is fantastic, and really the only reason to go. Loads of vintage signs and things and smack in the middle of the one dining room - a real vintage trolly car - completely renovated.. . of course I asked for us to be seated inside there.. . that was really neat. nnThen the food came.. . I had spaghetti and Meatballs and a Caesar salad. Now, the salad was really flavorful and fresh. Normally I hate salads in places like this. the lettuce tastes old and rubbery.. . not in this case. it was excellent. The spaghetti on the other hand - wow, watery, slightly overcooked noodles and sauce I bet was straight out of a Hunt's Spaghetti sauce can. the meatballs were frozen and reheated - i hate that off taste frozen meat takes on. so the salad got an A and spaghetti was a bit loser. nnMy stepson ordered the Italian wedding soup - he loved it - I did not try it.. . he also got the same watery noodles with the mushroom red sauce. Those mushrooms must have come straight from a can. they were button and the one I tasted had that tinned flavor.. .. so essentially this restaurant depends completely on frozen, processed, canned ingredients rather than fresh and flavorful. nnBottom line.. . have kids with you? they will love it.. . just the adults? find something.. . anything else.. . it is going to disappoint.",

Clearly they knew we were coming, so it shouldn't have been a surprised to them. nnOnce we were finally seated, it took 30 minutes from ordering our drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) to actually getting them to the table. We still hadn't even looked at a menu when the drinks finally did arrive. From there the service picked up slightly and we were presented with warm bread, garlic butter (decent) and salad. I dislike iceburg lettuce so this was meh. Given that we were a large party, obviously we were given a limited menu selection. I ordered \"The Incredible 15 Layer Lasagna\" and it certainly wasn't 15 layers, unless you count the loads of marinara on top as, say, 10 layers. My cousin ordered the same thing and ended up with a piece of chicken on his plate, don't ask me why. The lasagna was okay, but I've had better from a Stouffer's frozen meal. nnMoving onto dessert, I ordered the tiramisu. Might as well just call it white cake with \"espresso\" drizzled on top. It was still slightly frozen too. No thanks. nnFrom start to finish it took us over 3 hours to get our entire meal. Understandably, we weren't a small table of four so it will take longer, but it shouldn't have taken that long. Since we were there for a significant amount of time, we were able to observe what other's were eating/doing while we were waiting. Nearly everyone had enough leftover portions to take home and feed themselves at least once if not twice more.

And again, I cannot overemphasize how below par the service was. nnBut the thing which really upset me was when we got our check. They charged us dinner prices for each of our meals.

CRT-TV with about 100 cable channels. I had a router for internet but it was taken away from me 2 weeks into my stay. The Pennsylvanian claimed Comcast took it away without even telling me. They did not offer me a chance to pay for it. nnThe fitness room was nice. There are treadmills, elliptical machines, pullup bars, and other various machines. There are even a few sets of dumbells. I never used the sauna, so I cannot comment on that. nnThere is a 24 hour concierge that is always helpful and friendly. There is also an option to sign up for a dry-cleaning service, which is outsourced to another company. You drop your dirty clothes into a room and pick it up a few days later after it has been cleaned. This is rather expensive as well. Everyone who has a dry-cleaning Key has access to this room.

But the thing I think I've really grown to hate that weird brown sauce he puts on everything. Yuck! I just can't stand it! I know I can ask to have it off, but as soon as I seem to remember, it's on there in a flash. nnI know it may be cheap and it may be fast, but to me it's just not worth it.

I wouldn't trek all the way from CMU to have sushi there since sushi can be more easily had, but definitely for the Korean food. Some would disagree, but I have friends from Seoul who even think Sushi Kim has the best Korean food in Pittsburgh. (Granted we are speaking for Pittsburgh) It is pricier than Korea Garden, but the atmosphere is slightly more \"upscale. \"nnThey also have at least 3 brands of soju(Charm, Cheoeum cheo reom, and  Jinro Chamisul), which for Pittsburgh is quite exceptional even though I would only drink the Chamisul. They also have Korean noraebang, which you have to reserve in advance. However they only have Korean songs, so if you can't read Korean you're out of luck. They charge $30/hour. I'm not sure there is any other Korean noraebang in the city. I didn't try it, so I can't say what kind of selection they have for songs. nnThe BBQ is a great deal and though not the best I've ever had. It may be the only Korean BBQ grill place in the city.

It is not inexpensive (really, sushi is rarely inexpensive), but upon arrival, it is a bit too warm, and just doesn't taste fresh. Being that much of this dish consists of raw fish, freshness concerns me a bit more than, say, french fries at a bar.

It's a really fun and interactive eating experience. There weren't that many choices for proteins, but the choices that were available were all delicious. Protein choices ranged from mussels and shrimps to pork, chicken and beef. My favorite was the bulgogi beef. nnThere were a few things I disliked about the Korean BBQ at Sushi Kim though. First off, they offered no butter or oil for the BBQ. I understand that they are trying to keep things healthy and all, but without any grease, the food was easily burnt. Butter or oil should always be an available option. Secondly, I did not like the design of their hot plates--the interior cooking area was way too tiny so it took forever to cook the food. And finally, they need to add a DESSERT BAR. After eating all that grilled food, I craved something sweet and refreshing. But, Sushi Kim left me hanging. Sushi Kim is already charging a whopping $24 per person--it would be nice if they throw in a dessert bar to sweeten up the deal (pun intended). nnOverall, I'm very thankful there is a Korean BBQ place in Pittsburgh.

I have never had a wait staff say \"thank you\" and \"you're welcome\" more than this. They even joked with me as I ended up waiting 30 minutes for my delayed guest.

I guess it would be OK if you like your chicken parm buried in veggies and cheese. Me? I like my chicken parmesan to be mostly, you know, chicken. It wasn't bad, mind you, but I can make a better dish at home and I am certainly not an Italian restaurant. Can't say I recommend the meal I had here this day.

That doesn't express the depths of my enthusiasm for Klavon's. KLAVON'S RULES!! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! There, that's better. nnLet's take it in order. You have lots of dining options in the Strip. Now, Klavon's is a few blocks away from most of the popular places (we were at Salem's, which is also great, but that's another review), but it's easy to walk to and easy to find with all the neon signs. nnWhen you walk in to Klavon's, you're taken back in time. Choose a little booth or table, and gaze at the decor. Maybe you'll see an old liniment bottle from back when Klavon's was a drugstore. Maybe you'll notice the high-water mark from the 1936 flood (close to the ceiling! ). Maybe you'll see the old penny scale or the phone booths. This is a place where history is celebrated. nnThe menu isn't extensive, but you still have lots of choices. Why not try an old-time phosphate, malted, or egg cream? It was good enough for your great-grandpa; it's good enough for you. I treated myself to a root beer float. It was the best I ever had. The reason? Both the root beer and the ice cream were made locally. On the way out, why not browse the penny candy racks? For a quarter, you can try a bunch of hard-to-find treats. nnI'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Mr. Klavon, the grandson (I think) of the original owner, still runs the place.

I also like the frequent diner program, which gives you a 5% discount after eating there about 5 times and a larger discount the more often you eat there. They also send you specials via e-mail from time to time. On Wednesdays they give you two free chocolate chip cookies with your meal. On your birthday month they give you six free chocolate chip cookies. The cookies are usually served hot, right from the kitchen and are delicious. Max & Erma's also has a great bar. This location is just across the river from PNC Park and Heinz Field. You can grab the T about 1/2 block from Max & Erma's and get off at the North Shore stop, which is between the two stadiums.

I asked for ketchup and was told to find a table with a bottle. We are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup. It was definitely not Heinz which is a sin in Pittsburgh! I had to hunt silverware and straws. You would think they would give them to you with the meal. nnThey charge about $2 for a drink with no free refills. They put a sign that said refills are 50 cents and if you take one without paying you are stealing and subject to prosecution. You can also get a drink from their cooler for $1. They are no-name juices or water like you might find in a dollar store for 25 cents or less. nnTables were not very clean. I was surprised at the number of patrons. This place is definitely regularly visited. They have daily specials, but the #1 item on my list is quality and taste of food. They get a C from me.",

We found Zorba's on the corner and considering how cold it was neither of us felt like walking to search for food. nnWe stumbled in here after reading the outdoor menu mentioning specials. The hubby  ordered the buffalo chicken salad which is the special on Wednesdays. I went with the gyro salad which came with a side of pita bread. The hubby's salad was huge, topped with fries and plenty of chicken, not to mention lettuce. He choose balsamic dressing which I thought was weird but he enjoyed it. The fries were great, nice and hot while the chicken was mildly spicy but a little bit dry. nnMy salad was just as big but it was mostly lettuce. At first I thought they were a little scant on the lamb meat but  almost like the loaves of bread that Jesus fed to the hungry, it just kept showing up. I was a little disappointed at the quality of lettuce. I hate those big crunchy chunks that you find close the root, they are so bitter no matter how much dressing you use. nnSo the reason I give this place only 3 stars is because of my salad. Crunchy bitter lettuce, gyro meat was a luke warm instead of hot which after 5 minutes made it cold because of the chilled dressing. Not to mention the dressing was rather bland and they didn't add enough to my huge salad so i ended up ordering more which cost 75 cents. The fact that I had to order more dressing even though it had little to no flavor was disappointing. nnThere is enough seating in here but just some simple tables and chairs spread out, nothing fancy or worth taking pictures for. It's almost like a cheap cafeteria which I don't mind if the foods good but I wasn't impressed with my gyro meat or with the chicken on the salad. Sometimes places have an off day so I won't count this place out just yet. nnP. S bring cash only! !",

You know how when you get a jokey waiter when you're not \"that kind\" of table, you expect the waiter to get the hint and be more professional? Well I had the exact opposite experience.

The waiter was perfectly courteous and professional, but I thought he should have gotten that we were a more personable table.

Why not go with some standard italian dishes? Their menu doesn't include really any. My girlfriend tried to play it safe with the lasagna bolognese and they should have just called that a mountain of over-salted meat. There couldn't have been more than two sheets of pasta and two tablespoons of sauce in that dish. There is nothing worse than dry lasagna and if my girlfriend wanted to eat just meat she would have ordered just meat. Lasagna does in fact call for pasta. nnI ordered the halibut with polenta. I'll start with the polenta. Basically I should have just eaten my napkin because that had more flavor than the polenta. The dish came with San Marzano Tomatoes, Olives, and Capers over top of it and water passed off as sauce. Nothing annoys me more than when someone tries to go crazy with a fish dish. Let the fish do the talking. There were so many onions and capers on it that I needed to really dig for the fish. The halibut was good but it's a shame that the piece was incredibly small because the rest of the dish was subpar. nnThe desserts were very good however.

Second course, couldn't wait, Caesar salad and a dish with shrimp and spaghetti squash,  salad was ok, the shrimp you couldn't taste because they were the little frozen ones that are cute when breaded but when they aren't they just look sad, as if they had never been in the sea (which I am banking these hadn't). Then finally main entru00e9e, we held out hope thinking we there could still be a chance, again the price was $48 PER PERSON! My husband had gotten the tuna, JOKE, this made me maddest of all, it was pescado without the pescado part. We could have dealt with a small piece of FRESH tuna, but seeing as how this was an average piece of flash frozen crap with the grill marks already on it, thank goodness those poor chefs didn't have to actually grill a piece of fish. My pasta trio dish was ok, nothing about it screamed high and or fresh quality foods. The worst part was that the service was excellent other than he could see on our faces we wanted nothing to do with the food, so he never asked how it was, but he was fantastic. So after the frozen crappy desert or finger food, that was horrid, we got our bill all said and done with a glass of wine, cappuccino, tax and tip, we paid $150. 00! So save your money and go to spaghetti warehouse at least you know what you're getting. Lidia, YOU OWE US MONEY!",

I ended up getting the Saltimbocca alla  Romano which had great flavors but was overcooked. My sister got the sausage, which was okay, but not as great as we would expect for a restaurant owned by Lydia.

When you dine at Joe's restaurants, you get the sense that every single ingredient is hand selected for the highest quality and the presentation of the food shows care went into it.

A lot. I've definitely had better at similar quality establishments. The calamari was very bland and did not taste fresh. The batter was not crisp and crunchy. The sauce tasted watered down. The recommended \"Pasta Trio\" (3 types of pastas and \"all you can eat\") was a bit below average. For a recommendation, I expected more. Overall, the food was underwhelming. nnMy friend always cleans her plate. So clean, that it looks like she was served only the plate. This was the first time that she did not finish her dish (Chicken Cacciatore).

Nachos are no better than what you can get at 7-11 and sandwiches have no flavor. And service is piss poor and understaffed. I'm not sure if they recently changed ownership or what, but something was very very off here and they were obviously unprepared for the start of the football season. nnI feel bad because the people were very nice and apologetic, but that does not take away from the fact that even if they were showing my game, I think I'd still rather watch it in my hotel room.",

Oops - I guess it is a good idea to check before simply rejecting a delivery. To the hotel's credit, the manager did call and offer to send up an amenity or bottle of champagne for the mix-up and the delay of my departure by several hours. I thanked her but declined; several minutes later, hotel security was banging on the door asking me why I had not vacated the room. Wow. nnOne of the main reasons I stay at Renaissance Hotels is because they are known for being upscale establishments with a modern feel. I did not get that from this hotel, which seemed stuffy and boring. More Middle Ages.. . not Renaissance.",

It was all complimentary and the food was outstanding. nnThe room was spacious, clean, and updated to an extent. The shower needed some upkeep. My room had a great view of the city and river.

By the way, they obviously discontinued the minibar fridge because the power goes out when you leave the room. So why not take the fridges out of the room? Very amateurish to leave them sitting in rooms. nnThe hot tub/pool facilities are the kind where you have to sign in, show your key, and walk all the way through the locker rooms before you can enter the pool area that looks like it's a Mexican hotel in the 80's.

The fish itself was at least not overcooked or dirty, but it was a poor aesthetic decision to bread and fry the piece of fish, then put the breaded coating into soup.

She then said that she needed to seat people with reservations before she could seat us and completely refused to acknowledge that she had given us a misleading wait time.

Even when the customer is wrong, you don't blame them and say \"I'm sorry, but.. . \" You simply apologize and try to defuse the situation instead of getting defensive and escalating the situation.

I'm a huge fan of vindaloo, which is often the spiciest item on an Indian menu (at least in the United States), but at Taste of India, it's about as spicy as a can of Chef Boyardee Ravioli. I've tried asking for a spicy level of 11 on a scale of one to ten. I've tried asking for \"traditional Indian\" heat. No dice. Chef Boyardee Vindaloo, every time. nnAnother problem is the take-out ordering process. My wife and I have ordered take-out a couple times recently, and each time, we placed two orders for naan and only received one. Since we live in Point Breeze, going back to the restaurant for $3 worth of naan isn't worth the effort, but really, we should have just received the naan in the first place. nnGiven these issues, why do we keep going back to Taste of India? Simple: the biryani and korma are the best dishes this side of Stanwix Street. And, that's saying quite a lot.. . or at least enough to keep this review at three stars instead of two.",

I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can't remember the name) served over rice. My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl. Our food came fast enough and it was served hot. However, my dish was nothing to brag about. It was pretty average tasting Asian fare. It didn't taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality. Good thing it was only about 6 bucks.

My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles. The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection. Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll. The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all. It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion. The \"pork\" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something. It almost looked like boiled ground beef. I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious. As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars! Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for. I don't understand this either. The rolls were extremely bland and chewy. The sauce that was served with it didn't do much to save it.

Baby on board, we walked in and waited to be greeted. The inside looked a bit old and run down. Tip: they do not have highchairs only booster seats which is impossible to get a squirmy baby to stay in. I would not suggest bringing a baby here. The tables are also very small and close together. We actually had to move the table out to get in and out of the corner booth. I decided on the basic cheeseburger and ordered the boiled red skin potatoes for the baby and a side of chips for me fully expecting homemade chips. Not the case. I got a handful of what seemed to be a ruffles knock off. The potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side. Great for a picky baby. Bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty. Now to the burger. Huge, yes. Juicy, not even close. Despite ordering my burgers well done, I expect them to still be tender and juicy. This was not the case. My burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken. I ate half of it. We were in a bit of a hurry so I didn't mention it to my server, though I'm not sure it would have made a difference seeing hubs medium burger was also dry.

Because there were no mushrooms in my dish, she was suppose to take it off our bill but forgot so ended up giving a cash credit. Also I ended up packaging my Bolognese home since I couldn't eat it all and she asked if we wanted the rolls too and wrapped my pasta in saran wrap for the trip home to prevent any sauce spillage which was a smart move since we had walked here. nnOne comment though would be on the decor. You walk in and the bar area somewhat has a modern feel but then once you go into the dining room it is like you are warped back into time.

Not just a mash of veggies in a thick green curry. Truly one of the best curries I've ever had. It makes a dish that has become boring in most other places truly exciting. We had it again the second time and it was exceptional again. nnOur second dish was a whole spicy fish, which was also very good, and a nice compliment to the curry. First time, at lunch, I think I had a shrimp prik pow, and that was also very nice. nnThe Ginger Tea is also great. nnAs we were finishing dinner last time, I commented that the curry is so good that next time we'd have to try the Pad Thai. That's a dish we hardly ever get when its just the two of us, because it can be a bit generic, a safe choice for those that don't know or really like Thai food. But it IS the national dish of a truly world-class cuisine, and given what they do with the green curry, we thought, \"I bet it's really something special\"nnAs we were leaving, the owner thanked us for coming, and as we discussed the meal a bit she said \"Oh, you have to try the Pad Thai! The best in the city! \" I bet that's true, and can't wait to have another dish that's usually a bit of a yawn, turn out to be a real surprise in the hands of this great Thai restaurant.",

My favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno. While the wings were decent and cheap for the size, I had from day one thought the beers were a bit overpriced for the type of bar and location. The wings kept me coming back, and they were cheap, so I didn't mind paying a little bit more for a few beers. As time went on, the menu seemed to go through a few changes.. . a few less items, and higher prices, and severely decreased portion sizes. I understand that as with anything, prices are always going to go up, but at the same time, the quality should remain the same or get better! This was not the case here, after giving them a few tries, I gave up. On my last few visits the food was absolutely awful, the portions were minuscule, and overall overpriced. They also did away with the 50 cent wing night. It always seemed that all the owner was concerned with was the almighty dollar. I tried the the corned beef sandwich just after St. Patty's day last year, and the corned beef was almost all fat, it was so bad that they took the sandwich and had me order a new item from the menu. After that I tried the fish and chips around lent, and what a joke it was! You got potato chips ( not home made), and a few tiny pieces of fish that were almost all breading. All of the \"specials\" that they have, whether they are food or drink, are not worth the prices that this place seems to think that they are. All of their \"special\" prices are what most other places have as their regular everyday prices!

With lettuce, tomato, and cheese, plus mushrooms if I ask? Heck yes! \" Turns out despite the menu promising most of the toppings off the bat, either the cook forgot or someone new made my hoagie.

The sauce was so sweet, which is not normal outside of this region (not sure what sweet tomato sauce is about, but I don't dig it. There has to be sugar added or something. ). Dough was ok but wasn't that perfect medium for the simple yet magical tomato and mozzarella combination that it ought to be. If you are expecting New York style pizza, this is NOT the place for you.

Forget about parking- there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill. The later in the evening you go, the busier the dining room.

This store claims to offer opportunities for you to donate your goods so that they can buy them through \"Veterans of Vietnam\" who then resell your donated goods for a profit (google it I did). So there's zero charity factor to this store, its a fairly large chain for profit, profiting off peoples donations.

At this point I wouldn't even trust the food that comes out of their kitchen. nnUPDATE:   I was able to reach a regional manager via email, and he replied briefly that it was a situation that was being addressed. In the last month, I have been there 2 or 3 times with simple take-out orders and everything seemed to go fine.

Sick right? Well I'll have you know that I have seriously considered giving them a call and seeing if they would be willing to ship one to me in LA. No matter the cost. nI've tried a few other things there too. I think it was the fire bird. Which ever one had chicken and marinara. That was decent. Their loaded cheese fries are awesome. Lots of bacon bits. They call them something else though. Something car related. nMy boyfriends favorite sub was the carhops special (hot) which is a favorite of many. I didn't really stray to much from my usual sandwich but they have lots of other subs and pizza too. nnNow let me just say that in the past five years I have tried to find a decent cheese steak sub that is at least comparable to the z-28 but its just no use. That sandwich is unique to carhops and always will be. The only place that has even come close is Jersey Mikes sub shop in Burbank.

It was hardly a complicated order, but I've waited less time during peak hours at other fast food chains in the past. Thankfully, there was ONE girl working who saw me standing there for a long time, and asked, \"are his McBites up yet?. .. where are they? \" I was happy that someone had finally addressed the situation, but it shouldn't have taken that long. nnAgain, I'm aware that showing up at 11pm will probably increase my odds of walking into a late-night, preparing-for-the-next-day mess of a restaurant, but even in fast food, it's absurd to think that the level of cleanliness that I walked into is acceptable.

When I open them(it was not long, 30 minutes or less), they were so soggy, and based on my experience who grew up on Chinese food, it was not fried the second time. The difference? They tasted worse than Buffet dish sitting above the steamer for hours. nnFurthermore, I have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce. Shrimp was hard to chew. It seems like the shrimp the simmered in the sauce for ages. There was no aroma from garlic or onion. nnBeing a decent cook myself, I can tell you those dishes I ordered were not cooked by the main chef, or secondary chef.

I am not a person who can afford to pay some huge premium to buy the same thing at a small store that I can buy cheaper online, but he disabused me of that prejudice that the big online retailer was always going to be cheaper or the better value, even when compared with a store in a wealthy suburb like Mt.

It was homemade, and well made, however it was almost insultingly small.

I know for a fact that every Thursday they fly in many choice ingredients directly from Italia. This creamy delicacy is by far my best loved. It either comes on the DOC Margherita pizza or mixed in with some of the pasta selections. I always order the DOC as an appetizer then the Rigatoni Alla Siciliana. They also only use San Marzano tomatoes in the marinara sauces which introduces a bold rich flavor without as much acidity. The key to these dense, deep red fruits is that they are grown in the fertile volcanic soil in Italy. The Siciliana is an eggplant based dish that I find myself desiring often in my favorite dish spankbank. The perfect texture of the al dente pasta combined with the melt in your mouth salty, tart smoothness of the mozzarella and eggplant in the sweet heavily basil based garlic sauce is a party for the taste buds. I just keep eating until I am uncomfortably full. The wine selection is also above par, I enjoy the Berro Barberra. Full bodied, spicy, splashes of berry, and low in tannins. nnAs for the pizza, it is reminiscent of the famous brick oven pizzas of Da Michele found in only Napoli. The crust is extremely thin, light. and crispy. Follow that with my \"Piu00e8ce de ru00e9sistance\" mozzarella di bufala, tangy san marzano tomato sauce, and fresh leaves of basil you will find that simplicity is more.

Very relaxing before our 5-hour drive home the next day. nnIl Pizzaiolo has a great, rustic atmosphere. Dark wood, tan walls, delicious pizza smells. And a full bar. Very important. nnThe service was eh. It took the waitress at least 10 minutes to greet us and take our drink order, another 5 to get drinks and tepid water for the table. (Ew, chill the water. I know you're going for a Euro atmosphere but you're not in Europe. Chill the damn water. ) The appetizer got there after another 5 and then the pizza took forever. I don't know how since the menu claims they're cooked in 30 seconds in the wood burning oven. But no matter. On to the review. nnT got a beer and I got a mimosa. They were out of the peach juice that usually goes in a mimosa so it was made with blood orange juice instead. Delicious. nnFor our appetizer we ordered a sort of potato stick with cheese mixed in. Forget the exact name and they don't seem to have a website where I can check. They were. .. okay. A bit bland truth be told but the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top helped a bit. There was no salt and pepper on the table and our waitress was a bit absent so we sucked it up and ate the bland potato stick things. nnHowever, the pizza improved a somewhat mediocre appetizer. We got the Diavolo with spicy salami and chili flakes. Amazing. The crust was thin and chewy and not too black on the bottom. The cheese was salty and creamy and the salami was spicy and really tasty. Much better than pepperoni in my opinion. nnI suppose it's a good spot if you're in the mood for Italian.

Maybe my family is full of over-achievers, so my opinion may be harsh but for the type of food they are creating the price is outrageous. nnIf prices were lower my review would be higher and I say this with years of dining experience in Mt.

J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no wait, but the place was pretty packed. I started with some hot sake and a green salad. Their ginger dressing is delish! I was practically licking the bowl. I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came. J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best. The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness. Then came the sushi. We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop. What can I say, we like sushi. The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy. The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here. However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna. Everyone does a spicy tuna. At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around. Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna. No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it. The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll.

We eat with our eyes, nose, taste and tactile feel so while this tasted good it didn't do so well on the other requirements. nnThe mushroom and spinach dumplings were actually very blah, relying on the red pepper dipping sauce for their flavor.

The place is expensive for what you get, they should pay more attention to the parts, master making them correctly before you try fusing it into another cuisine to cover up your mistakes.

Soba's seasonality is something that makes it stand out, and I appreciate the sourcing of the ingredients.

My scallops were deliciously meaty and sugar sweet, and my vegetarian dining companion's vegetables all tasted quite fresh. The rhubarb in my desert had a perfectly tangy, subtly sweet flavor. Proteins and veggies stand out. nnBut the dishes, as a whole, don't warrant the price point. Soba tries to communicate subtlety in flavoring of its food, and it carries this principle of subtlety a bit too far. In fact, the food ends up being on the slightly bland, underseasoned side more often than not. For example, the broth in my entree tasted only vaguely of the soy and ginger promised, and my friend's red curry exhibited anemic spicing. Flaws in execution are similarly prevalent; my noodles and my friend's rice were too mushy. Such flaws didn't detract too heavily from the dining experience, but when I'm paying $70+ (appetizer, dinner, dessert, and drink) for a meal I'm expecting complex flavor and texture contrasts, deft seasoning, and meticulous technique.

I'd much rather go to Noodlehead and pay $20 for a much better meal next time.",

There is complimentary valet parking at Soba which makes parking easy. nnWe chose the crispy calamari as an appetizer and shared the thakkali curry and pad thai for the entrees. The crispy calamari was okay - similar to crispy calamari I had at other restaurants. The thakkali curry was very salty and there was not enough liquid to balance out all the vegetables. We had trouble eating the curry as the sauce was very pungent. The pad thai was nothing spectacular - definitely had better in NYC and Philadelphia. The portion sizes of all the food that we ordered were very generous.

I loved the bar area- has a mix of bar and casual couch/lovechair seating that's well suited for a date or small group.

I would return just for that dish. For an entree, I had the seared rare tuna. They definitely didn't skimp on my portion of tuna and cooked it well. Granted tuna is a bit bland, I was hoping for more seasoning and oomph from the Korean barbecue sauce. The ginger fried rice made up for any disappointment I had with the tuna.

I could have gone for another bowl. nnFor my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good. The accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least, they merely enhance the flavor of the fish. The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size - as in 1 bite without looking like you're stuffing your mouth. This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. I did not sample any other rolls tonight, but I'm sure I will be back to do so. nnMy dining companion had the chicken teriyaki. The dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen. Again, this was probably the best preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice. More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards. nnI didn't sample the desserts tonight, but I've seen others rave about them. I will definitely be back, as often as I can.

Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle and well-seasoned and incredibly fresh. (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear. ) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town. nnThe second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative and innovative, I'll definitely return here.

His was much bigger than my salad and came with chicken (i think it was $1. 00 more). nnWe didn't get alcoholic drinks with dinner and our bill was $29. 00 which isn't that much more than our bar tab for 2 drinks. nnPros: Lively, fireplace when you walk in the door, a bunch of vegetarian options, big drink list, nnCons: Pricey drinks, very dark inside, sub-par salads, \"funny\" menu ( you have to read the whole description to figure out each item, I understand how lazy that sounds but witty names are only good once in a while)nnOverall: Might go go back and not get a salad.

I truly understand the concept behind this. But can I be the first to say.. . IT'S NOT CUTE! For the drink menu, fine. I'll admit to having a few laughs at their PG-13 drink encyclopedia.

I still haven't figured it out, and it's at the point where if my friends want to grab food here, I'll make a point out of eating beforehand. Plus, oh WOW is this place overpriced! This was especially highlighted to me on a Sunday morning when our bill came to $42 for brunch. Not expensive, but the wheels started turning in my head.. . we just paid $42 for an appetizer, two entrees, and two bloodys, all of which were eh, passable. For exactly $6 more, we could have went down the street to Casbah and had TWO appetizers, two entrees, and two much stronger bloodys, all of much higher quality. nnThe reason I still come here though is the drinks. My favorite is the Happy Ending which involves pineapple juice, ginger, and cucumber. You really can't go wrong with anything though except for the Statutory Grape--if the name doesn't dissuade you enough, just heed my advice and don't order it.

Our table was facing the door, so I kept feeling the cold air every time people came in and out, and we were very close to the table behind us, beside us, etc. We eventually asked to move, but I thought the hostess should've asked us if that table was okay before seating us there - because I would've rather waited for a better one to open up. nnI thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor. I wanted an entree rather than a salad or a sandwich, but since I didn't feel like Mexican or a huge plate of macaroni & cheese, there were really only a handful of options. None of them appealed to me, so I ended up ordering the \"Henny Penny, \" a chicken sandwich. I asked for the spicy chipotle mayonnaise on the side because I have a really low tolerance for spiciness. When it came, the mayonnaise was on the sandwich. I said I would try it in case it wasn't that spicy, but when I took a bite I felt like my mouth was on fire! Then the waitress asked me if I knew the chicken itself was spicy. The menu said nothing about that, so I had no idea. She suggested they re-make it with plain chicken, which was nice, and it was fine after that.

What I got were more layers in the front, and he didn't even touch the back.

He kept going on about how great it looked, but all I could say was, \".. .

Sometimes they will have their kids with them during lunch time. Most college kids frequent the sub shops, coffee places, and larger bars on Walnut. The staff is always very nice and fairly prompt. nnFood: nThe food is pretty good. I have eaten several of their salads and have always enjoyed them. They are quite large so get ready to take a to-go box home or share some of yours with a friend. The sandwiches are great in my opinion. I've never tried one that I didn't enjoy. My sister is a vegetarian, so if this is your case don't worry, there are lots of options for those who don't enjoy a big burger or chicken sandwich. nnPrices: nThe prices are fairly cheap for being in Squirrell Hill. I would advise anyone to eat there because I don't think the prices are out of the park at all. Very affordable and the portions are quite large so it is well worth your dollars spent. : )",

Not far down the street, you can get a tiny morsel of ice cream for a stroke-inducing four dollars, but at Cappy's, you can spend a reasonable price on a reasonable meal. nnSo far, food-wise, I've tried the Alamo sandwich (I think that's what it's called, ) and the bacon-and-bleu-cheese burger (Big Bleu? ) Both of them were definitely satisfying, and the Alamo, with its fried chicken strips and barbecue sauce, was at the very least pretty good, even if it took a few years off the end of my life. nnGetting outdoor seating is key, though. They air-condition the bejeezus out of the inside area, and one time we accidentally showed up on karaoke night, which made us REALLY glad we found a table outside. Karaoke night is great when you're expecting it, but when you're not, there are few fates worse. nnService is usually kind of slow as well, but the wait staff is nice. One waitress we had was a little thick, though, when it came to splitting our checks. Nobody paid what they actually owed that night, but we didn't want to fight it out with her. nnAll in all, Cappy's is a nice, unpretentious little place to grab some food. I'll definitely go back.",

Heaven, pure heaven. nnGreat tip: My brother had it as his wedding cake. The store made three inexpensive fake round cakes that looked like burnt almond tortes and were on pedestals of varying height with beautiful fresh flowers at the base. You never, ever would have known they were fake. (I know it sounds super tacky but was not. ) Meanwhile, the actual burnt almond torte was delivered in sheet pans and cut in the back. So much more cost effective than having some over the top looking wedding cake. It looked beautiful and tasted so, so good. Out of towners who had never had Prantl's were amazed.",

I recently made a trip to BRGR the new gourmet burger joint several blocks away and their outdoor seating is quite hard to beat. nnThe food at Doc's is what you would expect to find at a greasy/beer/bar.

However, if you don't like to breathe in smoke while you're eating, pray that there is no one smoking in your section when you go.

Our server, Vito, was pleasant and attentive. nnFOOD: nDisappointing. The bread brought to our table was stone cold, and the accompanying butter was rock hard and still in the commercial packaging. I expect to get butter in little plastic tubs at a diner, but not at a relatively upscale restaurant like Girasole. Furthermore, the fact that the bread was cold and the butter was practically frozen made it impossible to spread. Not a good start. nnFortunately, it improved from there. The salad course was the highlight of the meal - the greens were crisp and the addition of sunflower seeds and bleu cheese crumbles gave it wonderful texture and flavor. This was the best part of the meal. nnMy steak was tender and the meat was of good quality. However, it was a tad under-seasoned and the accompanying risotto was undercooked and quite bland. The polenta that was served with my wife's chicken was also bland and under-seasoned. nnDesserts were average. I had the chocolate mousse cake, which sounded delicious, but ultimately the quality was on par with what you would get at a supermarket bakery. My wife had the coconut cream cake, which turned out to just be yellow cake with some coconut frosting. nnAMBIANCE: nProbably the best thing about this place. It is quaint and intimate. The decor is charming and it's in a lovely location. nnFINAL VERDICT: nProbably a better bet on an off-peak night and when the weather is nicer, but if it's a busy night and it's cold out, I'd give it a miss.",

Sometimes it can get pretty loud. nnHowever, the food makes up for what lacks in terms of atmosphere. I love that they give unlimited table bread with your choice of butter, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

The chicken itself was great - the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice.

This was an issue because 1 of my parents was out of town for the week. nnI tried compromising with them and seeing if they could change the agreement to give me an extra few days to get the cosigner paperwork in, or to see if I could just have my mother (who was more than financially stable) be the sole cosigner. They were unwilling to compromise at all, and I left after about a half hour of unproductive back-and-forth discussion. nnI could have gone back a week later, when both parents were in town, as the unit was still available, but I figured any place that difficult to work with when I was trying to give them money would be even more frustrating once I was contacting them for things like maintenance requests. I wouldn't say \"never ever rent from them\", but I would definitely be aware of how rude / difficult they can be.",

When we arrived there, however it was a different story. We were met at the door by the hostess (I presume) who did not take our arrival kindly and seemed annoyed that we were there. nnWe shrugged it off and went to the bar. The bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs. He acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for Miss Universe pageant constestants. And that's saying something. nnThe bartender would disappear for long periods of time, during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen. Mostly the sounds of silverware banging around. It was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on. We were there for about 2 hours  and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times. Most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen. nnEven when it came time to get our check, it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my card. nnTerrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place. I have no plans on returning. nnI hope this isn't deleted again, and if it is, I will make sure it's well known and will take printed copies of this and put them up around Sunnyledge and use every contact I have to get this printed in the Post Gazette and City Paper.

I also had the broccoli with garlic sauce, which is the dish I usually count on in Chinese fare, and it was a delicious compliment to the other dish.

The Raptor Center is a sanctuary for birds who would not make it in the wild, and they go to schools to educate young kids about raptors, so I didn't exactly feel bad paying since I knew it was going to a good cause. They had several different kinds of owls, eagles, hawks, vultures and other predatory birds. Most of the habitats seemed to be a decent size for the animal inside, and the birds themselves seemed relatively comfortable. There was also a little playground based on Harry Potter for the kids to play in, and they liked that. The staff there were very friendly and informative, and several who were transporting a bird from one area to the next were more than happy to take a few seconds to tell us a little about the bird and let the kids get a good look at it. nnMy nephew really enjoyed looking at all the birds, and he even knew a little on his own since the center had brought some birds over to his school.

After only 2 months use I called the store to tell them the sales clerk clearly did not know the product he was selling, if he did he never would have recommended this table. I was told they did not cover customer abuse and can't be held accountable for a sales person giving me bad information. It's the sylvan coffee table.. .. DO NOT BUY IT!! I dropped the remote control on it and it left a huge dent. They wouldn't even offer to come out to see if the table was defective or had the wrong finish. I told them I would bring it in myself and they said no. My end tables and cocktail table are extremely durable/well made and are exactly what I wanted. I am disappointed the table I was most concerned about is horrible.",

My wife had the Crab Feast, which she did enjoy. The Cheddar Bay biscuits made up for much, but if I get in the mood for those again, I may just phone in an order and pick it up. nnI just hope our server never goes to a zoo; I would hate for her to get dizzy watching the speed of the tortoises there. nnAs far me, I'm going to give this location a miss moving forward.",

They told me that they would give me a note for my boss if I would stay for however long it took. Seeing as I'm self employed that was no incentive and I told them so.

It smells like.. . \" to which he replied \"wet dog! \" which is exactly what I was thinking. It smelled badly like wet dog. How disgusting. Maybe it was the table--can you say dirty rags? While we waited for the rest to arrive, we got breadsticks and were also told that dessert for the birthday would be a charge. Really? Come on now. The bread sticks were pretty underwhelming--there was no garlic or flavor really. Booo. nnOnce everyone arrived, we placed orders. I got the Bruschetta Salmon. When I asked the waiter how it was, he said he hadn't tried it in forever but that people say it's decent--I appreciated that honesty! They served salad shortly     My goodness this place was slow though. The food took forever. When it came out, it was pretty lousy. I found two bones in the salmon before I quit eating it. The risotto pasta thing under it was so heavy and the salmon was sort of hard and the toppings made no sense. It felt like two or three dishes in one. Others' food didn't come out, so the manager came out and apologized and comped several meals. He even went up to the birthday boy and told him he'd comp his dessert as well. Thumbs up. nnDessert was actually pretty good--I got the chocolate tuxedo mousse cake which was quite good and it seems everyone else enjoyed theirs as well. The only reason this place is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is for service. Our waiter was personable and friendly, and the manager was excellent. I'd stay away from this garden like the plague, though.",

They are professional - you are dealing with folks who view this as their career and honor their work. n3. Consistency - it's very underrated! When I need to get my oil changed or car fixed, I want the same experience and no surprises. Carolina Tire delivers on that promise. n4. They have a good waiting area, complete with a children's play area, big screen TV and free wifi. nnOnly downside is that their location is not handy for walking to the mall or restaurants - if you need a ride they will take you to Lynx, but the location doesn't have a lot of stuff immediately next door. nnOverall I'm a big fan!",

Watch out for the kids and remember to dress warm and always fall with closed hands or you'll take home less fingers than you brought.",

This rink just didn't blow my mind. nnWe arrived right when the open skate time started (check their website for the schedule). The entry process is pretty simple. Walk to the building, pay your money ($10 for admission and skate rental) and grab your rental skates at the next window. nnThe negatives.. . I was disappointed by the ice quality and the rental skates. The surface of the ice was pretty rough and needed a serious resurfacing. The rental skates were extremely dull. Yes, I know that they are rentals but it would have been nice if the blades had a decent edge. I also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink. This would have provided better separation for general skaters (the people that just want to skate circles) from the more experienced/technical skaters (the people that want to spin and jump). I've been to rinks that used the cones and it provided a better experience for all skaters. It would have been helpful if all skaters were aware of skating etiquette.. . There were also a few times that I found myself having to dodge people going the wrong direction!! nnThe positives.. . They serve beer and wine!! If it wasn't so early in the day, I would have partaken. The employees that I interacted with seemed friendly enough. nnPineville Ice House doesn't have a lot of competition, which means they really don't need to change much to stay in business.

Fairpoint took over Verizon's local phone service in this area recently and this is a review of their ability to deliver. In a nutshell, it has been a disaster. nnFairpoint took over my land line at home and billing was screwed up. They got the new business when my office moved to Portsmouth. One day the landlines stopped working and our customers got a message that the number was no longer in service. When that was fixed, the lines didn't roll over properly. The billing was never correct. The internet connection required rebooting the DSL modem up to 15 times a day. Calls about all of these issues rarely went well. People were apologetic but problems remained. Calling about the same problem twice usually resulted in two different answers. Two different people in my office were reduced to tears. Most people and companies I know with Fairpoint in New Hampshire and Maine are having similar troubles.. nnMy company switched carriers recently. Fairpoint managed to delay the switchover but it ultimately happened. Someone from the new company was in our office for a few hours and since then, everything has worked perfectly. nnTo Fairpoint's management, I can only say that you bit off more than you could chew. Whoever made this decision was either given bad information or they just didn't care. I hope you are fined out of existence. nnTo New Hampshire's Public Utility Commission, I have to say that I have no idea what you do. I should review you separately. nnI don't generally give out one-star reviews. This is my 500th review and only my 12th one-star review. I'm not giving details because all of the billing issues aren't resolved, but I will say that if anyone is looking for a phone company in Northern New England, Fairpoint is not the company you want to go with.",

We both have experienced this type and other kinds of massages in many different places, NJ, NY, California to name a few. nHere are my main issues: n1- we are greeted by a very nice woman who does not understand or speak English. We ask questions and we are answered 'yes' every time. When we asked about the spa pools (are they hot or cold water? ) we get a 'yes'. I ask again, are they hot? We get a yes. SHe leaves and we touch the water and both pools are ice cold. We find the hot tub, figure it out ourselves and the jets, which do not move, are facing straight up, therefore making a huge mess and we can't sit in front of the jets to loosen up any muscles. It was a joke. n2- the hallway from the pools to the locker room is so sterile, I thought I was in a hospital. n3- my massage, was all about the stones. My very nice therapist added hot stones then removed them over and over again for 50 minutes. SHe didn't massage anything. I kept on waiting for the manipulation to start, thinking she was maybe warming me up and relaxing my muscles and she was going to start the actual massage any second. Then we were done. What the heck? My friend's massage included an actual massage. n4- the tranquility room is an open space right off the showers. there is no tranquil anything about this 'room'. No soft lighting, no blankets (I was quite chilly), no anything to make me feel I was in a special place to enjoy my quiet time. n5- the pleasure of this experience, and i use that term kindly, cost me a whopping $175.

I told him I am on my feet all day and I have back problems so I would like him to focus on my back and to please not rub my feet. He did the total opposite. He maybe rubbed my back for 5 minutes ad did my legs and feet for the rest and the time. Then told me one of my legs were shorter than the other and I should get it checked out. I'm sorry but that was so rude he could have tried to say it nicely. The lady who did my blowout was very sweet but my hair was still wet at the roots when I left and the ends of my hair was fizzy. For $40 I expected so expected something a lot better. Lastly I got a manicure I didn't need more than a buff and polish because I get a manicure once a week anyways.

My visit was at 2pm and we experienced some difficulty with parking. It also is DNC week and parking is off limits except for a few places along the street. Luckily we found one after circling 4 times. We walked in and it was awkward. One of those moments that you see in movies where a bar is noisy everyone stops and stares then goes about their business. Normally this isn't an issue but when the waitress and bartender does this its.. .. awkward. We found a booth and sat and waited to be greeted. We waited, looked around and waited some more. Began looking around saw a bartender and that was it. No waitress no one else walking around. Wasn't sure if we should have sat at the bar to be noticed, or like in elementary school raise our hands to have permission to speak. It would have probably made a difference to recieve a smile or simple hello from the person behind the bar, then we probably wouldn't have felt forgotten. After 14 minutes we finally met our waitress who asked us if we needed more time to review the menu. Really? We counted 3 parties, thats it.. . in a otherwise bare restaurant. Food was good, received it pretty quickly. Our drinks were refilled often without being asked. First impressions really do matter. It wouldn't have mattered from that point if service was perfect. Don't ignore someone intentionally when they obviously know you can see them. From reading other reviews it seems that we aren't the only ones who experienced the same issues. Really felt like we were being intentionally ignored. We did something we  have never done. Intentionally left without leaving a tip.

        "content": "nnNow, for the reasons why this hotel fails for a 4-star (Westin) hotel: n1. FOOD. The restaurant (Ember, Bar 10) is a pretty terrible and relatively expensive choice. Examples: Omelet = $18, and it is greasy, tasteless, and they used canned mushrooms; Breakfast buffet (the reason I got the omelet) is typically left to become stale and lukewarm; Dinner choices are typically salty (i.e. Fattoush salad) and greasy (i.e. sandwiches and burgers). I will say that the pancakes were excellent, but they are not the best (nor do they beat Hyatt's pancakes). nn2. LOCATION. While the Omni and other comparable hotels surround restaurants, shopping, and other area attractions, this hotels is 5 blocks from anywhere (even a pharmacy). Need I say more? nn3. SERVICE. No doorman, concierge has no good suggestion but \"Try Ember, \" and housekeeping seems to come only when you are in your room. On housekeeping, I am also quite sure they do not even vacuum as some cracker crumbs I spilled were still there TWO days later. They also tend to forget some essential (i.e. washcloth or soap). nnIf this were a cheap, sub-$100 per night hotel, I would manage. For Charlotte, which is not terribly in demand, this hotel should be spotless, sexy, or at least charming. It is neither, and for that reason, I suggest one try other hotels before this one.",

When I did get through to someone I was rudely told that only one person was answering the phones for the entire place. BTW, no one ever showed up to fix the air. nnI also have a problem with a place that wants to charge for internet access. Even the mom and pop hotels offer free in-room wifi or wired internet and with what this place charges it should be included. nnThe last thing, you get dinged for 18. 00 just to park and if you aren't careful they'll double bill you for it if you've prepaid for the room.

NINE DOLLARS for a bowl of oatmeal in the morning, or $20 if you wanted the breakfast buffet.

The room and bath I'll be nice and call cozy. There's free wifi, the ubiquitous minibar with astonishing prices, and a nice breakfast. nnHere's the bad points. Staying here treats you to surly employees that don't even look at you when answering a question. I mean seriously why you gotta be so mean to me after I checked out?! I asked if I could get my parking validated since I didn't have a room key to get out for free anymore, and parking is some ridiculous price of about $7 per hour.

Onto the toppings, lettuce, jalepeno, sour cream, guacamole and cheese to complete my order. The chicken, just like the other location was great and the pulled pork was awesome, I wil definitely try that again. The chips were fresh, some with a little extra seasoning that I love.

The place is casual, upbeat and friendly. Good for dropping in alone and unannounced. nnConsn-Salad - the 'garden salad' is billed on the menu as a $2 add-on to your entree. I make a point of regular ruffage while traveling, so I took the bait. What I got was literally a bread plate with about an inch-deep layer of iceberg lettuce, a single slice of cucumber and a plastic cup of ranch dressing. I ordered honey mustard. This was about as 'gardeny' as a plastic-wrapped airplane salad and way too much money for what I got. I usually won't mind paying upwards of $10 for a properly vegetated salad, but for $2 this was wickedly overpriced considering an entire head of this lettuce costs about $1 retail. n-Shrimp and Grits - just ok, bordering on the meh.

As for the Southern sampler - the salmon cakes were flavorful, I liked them, though my hubby thought they were too soggy. Nothing remarkable about the chicken wings or the fried green tomatoes.

The fish had bones in it and one got caught in the back of hubby's throat. The greens and yams were ok. The WORST was the red beans; tasted like they were cooked in a caldron of hell. I got peach cobbler and could not eat it because it was disgusting!! ! Horrible!! ! If I go to a place especially a mom and pop and spend almost $40 for 2 dinners and 2 desserts it should be excellent. I have gone to mom pop shacks spend under $20 and got excellent food like grandma makes. I would not recommend this place and would never go back. I can't believe people like this food.

Actually the woman at the table of three directly across from us kept telling customers to \"go away\" when they came dine. She also was served the wrong meal but no one ever came back to check on her. nnWe started the meal with the fried green tomatoes - Fresh green tomatoes battered in a herb and flour blend, lightly fried to perfection and served with our own remoulade sauce - it was served with our cornbread and the server said she would return with side plates but never did. She never refilled our drinks either. The fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them. It was hard to find \"tomatoes\" in the dish. I would resist trying this appetizer. nnWe waited a long time for our main course which is why it was probably cold when it arrived at our table. Scott had the special beef tip omelet with potatoes. He had asked for wheat toast but we were told they had none and they would bring white. They never bought the toast or asked if his meal was good. I tried the Mert's famous salmon cakes. These were dry and cold and my sides the macaroni & cheese - tasty - and okra & tomatoes - greasy? - were also suffering from being left sitting waiting for someone to bring them to our table. nnAfter finally chasing someone down inside we got our check.

You've gotta be crazy to not like the place. They serve everything from fried chicken, corn bread (with each meal), BBQ beef ribs (since I don't eat pork, that was definitely a winner for me), and lamb chops. My favorite sides are their mac & cheese, collard greens and sweet potatoes. At first taste, I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I felt like I was in my Mother's kitchen again.

I had the salmon cakes, which were the best I have ever eaten. These are not your grandma's salmon cakes- no canned stuff here. This was fresh salmon which they poach in house. It was perfectly seasoned, nice and moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. It is served with a remoulade that compliments it perfectly. My two sides were candied yams and okra and tomatoes. The Yams were delicious- not overly sweet but still nice and gooey and pleasing. The okra and tomatoes were good, although interestingly enough, there were no tomatoes in my serving. Just okra. It didn't matter. I gobbled it up anyway. Everything was served promptly and at the proper temperature, the du00e9cor was warm and welcoming, and the service helpful and friendly. You should have nothing to complain about if you come to Mert's, unless you are a chronic complainer.

There is a good mix of appetizers, sandwiches, salads and entrees from which to choose. There are also daily specials. The only one I can ever remember is the Friday Fish and Chips because it's always the special I want and it's never Friday when I'm there! nnI mostly land on the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp.

Also opted for the Tomato Bisque yesterday. It was quite good. Nice balanced flavors, hot, creamy, delicious!

When we arrived on Thanksgiving Day, the restaurant did not have a menu - it was a buffet. Never was this mentioned during our 15 minute phone call when I made the reservation.

First, let me say they put the slice of pizza straight in a brown bag, not horizontal. So, needless to say when I got back to the office the toppings had literally slid off, the slice was soggy and the bag was covered in grease, ugh! As for the salad, the onions were brown, and I mean bad brown, plus the lettuce was brown and wilted as well. So, I slid all the toppings off the pizza, ate the dough and ate the garlic knots, after having tried to pick through the lettuce and onions for something fresh, NO. nI should have known this would have been a bad experience when the guy at the counter was rude and things moved very slowly with only three people in the restaurant.

I got the impression she was angry with us because she was just not very nice. She didn't come back to the table after that for 20 minutes. I got the Fresh House Made Mozzarella Sandwich and it was just a sad sandwich. It sounded so good, but the ingredients were wimpy. There wasn't enough tomato (which were not ripe) to cover the bread, and there were maybe 2 shreds of onion. There was nothing fresh about it. nnI also ordered an Angry Orchard Cider (not on the menu) which I had to ask if there were any ciders. The waitress did not say the price but beware they are $5. 75. Too expensive in my mind for that drink (but what could I do at that point? ). nnThe location is convenient, but I would much rather go to Queen City Q.",

We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night). Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware. nnIt took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was \"we can't split this salad. \" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish. nnThe main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - sautu00e9ed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it.

It was totally tasteless and un-inspired. None of us even finished half the portion. When the waiters helper asked if we were done, we told him to please take them away and how horrible they were. The three men had the filet for our main course. It was a very middle of the road filet. I am not sure if they lowered their quality for restaurant week but it tasted no better than an Outback Steak. Even my 15 year old recognized the poor quality of meat. My wife had the Salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting. She only ate half the portion and it was not worth packing up to take home. The mashed potato side was amazing and the creamed spinach side was average. The creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing. I would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show. nnThe service was also only marginal. A big let down compared to the service received at lunch.

I finally got a call back to schedule surgery and it's a day before my surgery and I still don't have pre-op instructions. Still waiting on more phone calls to be returned. I have yet to talk to Dr Higgins or his nurse about my results. nnAfter all the stress of just dealing with Dr Higgin's office, he's very conservative in his approach. He scheduled a colpscopy and then when I came in for my procedure, after paying $40 co pay he says, without even examining me, that he didn't think I needed a colposcopy despite a bad pap he wouldn't check. Now a year later I have high grade pre-cancerous cells that have been unchecked for a year. nnAfter this current surgery I'm finding another gynecological oncologist.",

Food concessions was a big disappointment. Bogangles were all over the place. Other sports complexes over a superior variety, and your choices were limited here. Was disappointed, since the web site had limited ticket availability, and yet there were way to many empty seats. Before and after the game the city police are controlling traffic.

There are two entrances (one on 6th Street, one on Tryon), and if the line is too crowded at one, I suggest checking out the other (when we were there, 40 people must have been waiting in line at 6th Street, but upstairs on Tryon was empty).

We considered the IMAX, but with the 2 year old we decided, with the advice of the lady at the admission desk, that it would be a bit much. We did see The Little Prince in the smaller 3D theater and that was quite enough 3D for us. We didn't spend any time in the hands on room for the little kids.

We enjoyed both wines. After that, I don't remember our selections. nn4. The menu featured some great-sounding dishes, even though both of us got the bison special. I loved everything on the plate. It was served over grits (one of my favorites) with wilted spinach, I think. The bison itself was very delicious. I like my meat rare, and this was cooked (or rather, not cooked) to perfection. They messed up my husband's order, but recovered quickly, and he still left pleased. nn5. And finally, the bowl of foil-wrapped fruit candies by the door sent me home very happy! nnThe only thing that was a little sub-par was the service. They were very busy, and I think they were short-staffed. I don't think it was our waiter's fault that Jim's order was wrong, but he was not as apologetic as I would have liked. It also took him a few more minutes than it should have to check on us, and discover the mistake. This, however, changed neither of our opinions that we had just had a great evening out together.",

We ordered the hummus, which is served with pita slices and crackers. It is some of the best hummus I've ever had, and there were even a few olives to nosh on while we had our drinks. Service in the bar area was very good. nnMoving into the dinner portion of the evening, the service was still great. The food options for dinner were slightly lacking in my opinion. So lacking that I ended up ordering the goat cheese and herb chicken (I hardly ever order chicken when eating out since we have it at home all the time). The chicken was good, but placed on mashed potatoes that were literally drowning in butter sauce. I hardly ate any of them. nnWe both ordered the delicious tomato bisque for a starter. My dining partner ordered the hanger steak and hardly ate any of it; said it was really not good at all. In all actuality, he ended up eating half of my chicken. For dessert we split the chocolate torte with vanilla ice cream, which was very rich (as a chocolate torte should be). nnAlso, note to that if you're going to valet (which is highly recommended for parking uptown), it's off of College Street, not Trade. Ultimately, I would highly recommend Sonoma for lunch but not so much for dinner. There are too many other great restaurants uptown with better dinner options.",

We called Best Buy who contacted them and requested they get in touch with us. After about 15 phone calls from Best Buy, my husband, and myself, we just have up. Not one of these calls was ever returned and no one answers the phone during business hours so it is impossible to follow up. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! nnNow we are working with another Geek Squad recommended company but having problems since our dryer was under warranty and the company already paid for the part Carolina Appliance ordered for our dryer (and is apparently holding hostage). Not to mention, it will now be another week and a half or two weeks for the part to come in again - leaving us without a dryer for a month and a half. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Probably the least professional business I've ever worked with. Beware! !",

They force you to pay to park to be able to go into the park. This isn't just for premium parking, but its for general too. This is just another way to rake the park goers over the coals. Having to pay to park, really made me not ever want to come back here. nnAs for rides, we focused mainly on Rollercoaster, and wanted to get as many of them as possible. The Eliminator (Nascar theme and biggest in the park) was fun, fast, and rough. You experience at a lot of G's and airtime on this ride, but my head paid the price and was rattled. Afterburn had to be my favorite of the day, but we experienced a big delay due to someone getting sick on the ride. We finished the night with Nighthawk, and waited inline for about 1. 5 hrs. It was a really fun ride, but not sure if it was worth the \"wait 1 min for 1 seconded of riding\" ratio. nnThe rest of the rides were entertaining, no other great recommendations. nnThe park was crowded on a the Saturday night, but not painful to move around through the park. Everyone was friendly having a good night out. nnSome of the bathrooms were really old and disgusting. nnFood was expensive and not that awesome. We missed a deal were we could have got a full pizza for $11 dollars, but the staff didn't inform us and sold us 2 slices for $9 instead. nnOverall, it filled in a slot in a a empty evening, but I think I have either grown out of themeparks or this one just didn't do a go job of re-instilling the magic of them.",

I have no idea how no one has fallen out riding this - the seating design is revolutionary and freeing and allows completely uninhibited body movement from the waste up. It is the only coaster my husband felt terrified of while riding and he begged to skip this one a second time around. I, for one, felt very secure for some reason and loved the height and speed. It was a serious thrill. nnA first for me was the backwards coaster, Cobra. I'd never experienced this kind of design and it was such a blast. The first drop going forward is amazing, and then you reach the midway point and reverse going backward while going upside down multiple times. It was scary, exciting, and unique. nnI really liked how the park was designed - no space was wasted. You do not have to walk a quarter mile between fun things to do. The park is huge and hosts a surprising amount of roller coasters, but we did not feel exhausted walking the park itself all day. It was incredibly easy to navigate. Additionally, there were so many cool kid's exhibits and rides that were a big step up from most amusement parks I'm accustomed to. nnMy only real gripe is with some of the workers. We spoke with a handful that were just really, really weird. Not creepy.. . Just a bit off. There was a lot of over sharing involved. The guy that did our caricature portrait also flat out sucked! The drawing was AWFUL! It was disappointed and not creative at all. Kind of middle school grade. nnThis is a great park and absolutely a must do if you are in the Charlotte area.

Same with my ginger ale. Bar service appeared to be pretty speedy as well. But food service was horrid. Slow, slow, slow. nnSeveral of the people in our party ordered a chocolate cake dessert at the time they ordered dinner - apparently it takes a while to prepare. Well, our server didn't really seem to notice that other people at the table might want some dessert, and was almost shocked when two of us asked for dessert menus when the cakes started arriving. nnAn order of ice cream and another of berries went completely unserved, though we waited twenty minutes or so for them. I understand if one of the little cakes was ordered, it might take a while to cook. But how long does it take to scoop some ice cream and throw some berries on a plate? nnI doubt we'll be back, but it isn't completely about the service. The food just wasn't that great, and it was a bit pricey. Nothing wrong with paying up for great food, but Blue wasn't it.",

Side note: the service was phenomenal, no problems in that department. When it arrived, we both found the steak to be EXTREMELY tough. I know it's not a filet, but you're supposed to be able to get your knife through it without breaking a sweat. I didn't try my friend's steak, but he actually sent his back for being virtually inedible. He swapped out for a filet with blue cheese and was quite pleased that he did. Maybe I should have done the same.. .. I don't know, but if you have to send your food back in order to get a decent meal, it's a pretty bad sign, especially at an expensive establishment. In Blue's defense, I believe they were pretty upset about my friend's meal -- we basically got an entire desert tray for free.

Nice touch. nAppetizers: Choosing cheese and then pairing them with membrio, walnuts and bread was lovely. The house bread with butter mixed with kalamata olives was a wonderful touch. The calamari rivaled your favorite sports bar (I expected better). The Flavors of the Mediterranean plate was good but not extraordinary. It was a nice option from standard fare for certain though. nMain meal: For the price we each agreed we didn't get anything special. Certainly the seasonal Jumbo Scallops on Risotto was good, but it wasn't lovely. Almost too salty and there was nothing tying the seafood with the grain. And I adore both items. The Bolognese was described as 'eh' and 'standard' and the two who got the pork roasts were equally so-so in review and description. nAtmosphere: A jazz trio started up as we ate and it added a light and fun atmosphere to the experience. Tables around us were in good spirits, the lighting was set just right and there was enough space to move between tables (very uncommon in SF). It was nice. nnConclusion: This was a good experience but not great. I don't want to think because this is a smaller town then I'm used to, \"nice\" local places  = lower standards. I tend more to think there were good ideas here not executed to their fullest. 3 stars is all about the food which is ultimately why we pay these prices and go to these places.

The lobster roll was a huge disappointment. The menu description was boiled lobter with cucumber. And it was just that, but the lobster was hard, like cardboard, and hard to chew.

The rice was perfectly cooked and not too much either, just the right amount. Overall I was very satisfied, but would love a few sushi lunch options.

They have toaster and round loaves-which just mean the size of the loaf (I had no clue what they meant when they asked this so I just said toasted in an inquisitive way). Their bread has no artificial ingredients or preservatives and according to their website, shouldn't be refrigerated but can be frozen (they gave me extra bags when I told them I want to freeze mine). nnThey also have a bread card where you buy 12 loaves, you get one free. When I saw others put three $$$ for price on here, I don't agree. The loaves are about $5 a pop and most bread at the supermarket is an average of $3 so I don't think the price is too high, especially for freshly baked bread without preservatives or artificial ingredients. I dig how they have the nutritional info on their website so you can see what you're taking in.

My wife is all about dessert so she wanted the s'mores one.. . milk chocolate, marshmallow creme flambeed with graham crumbles. We added a swirl of peanut butter in it too and it was awesome. I liked doing the blondies and pineapple and she loved the bananas, strawberries, pound cake, brownies, oreo rolled marshmallows.. . she loved it all. 2. 5 hours later we were ready to roll one another out.

This was the worst Indian I've had in Charlotte. At twice the price. I now know why this place is always empty. I have also tried the lunch buffet and while the price was better. The spice was horrible. All bland, boring curries and an always empty naan bin. Had to ask to get naan. This place is PERFECT if you have money to throw away and want mediocre Indian.",

It was very straightforward and simple. They had the food ready exactly when they said they would. The servers and cashier were very friendly and courteous. nnI tried the plain naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, and mutter paneer. I even found some papadum and mint sauce wrapped up in my bag, which was nice. For some reason, having the papadum feels nice and familiar. The naan was alright, but not as fluffy as I had hoped. It was crispier in a lot of places, and I think it just needs to be a bit thicker. The chicken in the tikka masal was very good and very moist (yes, I know a lot of people hate that word. It's a good word to use in this case! ). The vindaloo was decent, except that the chunks of meat and potato were enormous. I was taught to eat Indian food by a Sri Lankan, which means I eat with my hands. I'm not used to having to pick up a giant wedge of potato and figuring out how to eat it cleanly. The mutter paneer was also alright, but the paneer was kind of tough and not soft like I'm used to. nnLike I said, it hit the spot, but I wouldn't order the vindaloo again, and I'm iffy on the paneer. Maybe it needs to be more fresh? I don't know how paneer works. The biggest issue was the salt level in the food. There was WAY. TOO. MUCH. SALT. If you are one of those people who loves to add salt, then this is all for you. I will give it another try, but only if they might agree to ease up on the salt.. . a lot.",

On the West coast (where I was raised), chow mein refers to the steamed soft noodles and \"Hong Kong style\" refers to the crispy style fired noodles. However, here on the East coast, \"chow mein\" is assumed to be the crispy Hong Kong style, while \"lo mein\" refers to the soft steamed style. Who knew? nnAt Cherry House, however, chow mein seems to refer to a bunch of fried rectangular morsels of friedness. I think they are the ones that you find in soup sometimes. In any case, I was a little let down. nnThat said, in a fix it is a perfectly viable option. The lunch combinations are a fantastic option at $6-$8 for main dishes with fried rice and egg roll, spring roll, or crab rangoon. A filling lunch for two coming in at under $13? I've had worse.",

They split the salad, served it on two plates, and charged us a $2. 50 \"split plate fee\". You're kidding, right?

It was just our luck because there was live jazz music being played that night. During the restaurant week, this place does have a very good choice of Entrees. You will be served with a 3 course meal with the addition of a glass wine of your choice. We had the cup of seafood gumbo to begin with. The soup served was the right quantity. Not too much or too less. Soup was warm enough. The contained scallops, shrimp, vegetables. For the entree, we had Diane with Chicken and Fresh Fish (blackened Tilapia). Both the chicken as well as fish we cooked well. The topping on the fresh fish were great. The diane chicken had a variety of vegetables on it along with rice. You can also have shrimp and chicken together in it. The food was warm. The third and final course is a dessert of your choice. We chose to have the Key Lime Pie. I cant remember much but I don't think a Key Lime Pie can go wrong at all. The server was definitely very polite and nice to us. She was checking on us at regular intervals and the food was served in a timely manner. During restaurant week, I would say the price of the meal is $$.

Coming from a Chicago native, that is ridiculously affordable. Once you head in, evaluate your security options. If you're a seasoned traveler, I recommend checkpoint A.

Not too shabby.. . but I will admit that I am a master maneuverer, and walk with relaxed-looking lightning speed. So maybe add a little extra time for the lollygaggers. Nice thing is there're some little shops there in the middle. Relax, check it out. Then be on your merry way. nnOH! One last pointer: AWESOME place to come in internationally.. . it took me like 3 seconds (again, slight exaggeration) to get through customs. There were plenty of lines, re-entering through security was also well-organized. It honestly is THE best place (and I've been through a lot of airports internationally) I have ever been when re-entering the US of A. Highly suggest making this your international airport (when possible).",

The hangar includes a few glass case displays, isn't very well lit and smells a little of motor oil (to be expected I guess). Apparently there are a few more aircraft outside but due to a security issue, there is no access to those. The show stopper is the Miracle in the Hudson US Airways airplane. As  of July 2nd, it's still being assembled but is on display with a rolling video feature of a TV documentary detailing the actual events. The first thing I noticed was that it's LITTERED with corporate logos. That's terribly disappointing. The museum has a Smithsonian type attraction and to see corporate advertising all over it was upsetting. My hope is that those will be removed at some point and the museum will allow people to actually board the plane. If neither one of those happen, I think it'll be embarrassing for the museum, the city and for the folks who paid $11 to see an iconic attraction they way it was supposed to be seen. If you don't HAVE to see the Miracle aircraft, my advice is go to an airshow near you. You'll get to see some aircraft actually in the air and most include a \"static\" component.

They are deep fried and then dunked in barbecue sauce. I will say that it is unique; however as the above would suggest, it is quite greasy.

It took a little while to get my food, but not so long as to start thinking, \"where is my food. \" The server dropped my tray off and quickly moved on the the next car without getting my money. Odd, but probably the most efficient. The pork was minced with sauce on it. The slaw was also minced rather than being shredded. There was also a sandwich bun along with the fries. I was able to get some pork without sauce to try first. The pork was moist and tender, but very bland. I then tried some of the pork with the sauce and the sauce was bland too. There was no smoke flavor at all. The fries were good, fluffy on the inside, but not quite crisp enough. The slaw was crunchy and fresh, but it too was bland. I don't really care about the sauce. Tastes vary and some like it spicier than others. But the pork although being tender and moist was disappointing. Overall it wasn't a bad meal, but it wasn't good either.

So, on the return we gave ourselves a little time to check out the BBQ King. It's an old school drive-in with an intercom ordering system. I thought it was kind of cool. What first struck me looking at the menu was the lack of BBQ items. I saw burgers, steak, fried chicken and similar drive in type items. But I didn't worry because I had a plan to try the BBQ chicken; and for good measure I choose the minced BBQ sandwich. nnWhen the food came, I was surprised the BBQ chicken was fried chicken covered in BBQ sauce. It then dawned on me that in the Carolinas BBQ is pork; like the minced sandwich I ordered. Unfortunately, in my search for good BBQ, the BBQ King was not going to be my fix. But I had to try the food. I took a bite of the chicken and it was delicious. The sauce was vinegary and the meat was moist and tender with a nice crunch. I won't call it BBQ, but I will call it good! They did a decent job with the pork sandwich but it didn't really taste smoked. I put some coleslaw on it and it really made a nice sandwich. nnWould I recommend BBQ King? It was unique enough that with full disclosure yes. Would I go back again?

Some of the other reviewers said this was a Charlotte institution, but I haven't been here long enough to know that. I just know they need to change the inside because it's a bit creepy. So, I ordered the chicken cheesesteak, fries and some coleslaw. This is not authentic if that is what you are looking for. the cheesesteak was soggy. I got mushrooms which were runny. What was more disappointing was that the chicken was like steakums and it was one layer of chicken on top of a glob of mayo, tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. Basically there was no chicken plus it tasted like shoe leather. The fries were ok. Not as crispy as others stated and they needed SALT! I didn't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross. The coleslaw was full of mayo, so I didn't eat all of that either. The pickle was good even though it was really salty, but I like pickles so I'm bias. I can say I probably won't go there again and I should have just gone to Subway. Take it or leave it.",

There are few rolls to choose from, and a medium sized menu for sashimi and nigiri. nnWe ordered salmon and tuna nigiri.

(The Ikura can say a lot about a place.. it should be wet and firm, so they explode in your mouth when you apply pressure with your teeth. If they are sticky, deflated, over-salted and mushy, they are no good, and the pace probably isn't either. ) nnMy brother got the pork ramen soup and said it was the worst he has ever eaten.. the noodles were pasty, the broth had WAY too much salt, etc. He said it was worse than the packaged stuff. nnThe place was also dirty, especially the bathrooms. nnIt was a horrible experience in almost every way a place can be horrible.

I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold, rainy night and it sounded very comfortable, like memories from college days. The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles. I don't eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good, but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll. The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers! We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent. Overall this place was just ok. I may be back for some take out ramen but honestly I could probably just make my own at home for 95 cents and add some veggies.",

When they are busy, it may take them just a tad bit longer to get to you. nnPrice - Was alright, not too shabby, and reasonable at best. nnSo bottom line, I like the food.. . but I am in no dire need to come back.

The chicken katsu was just what I was expecting, nothing more nor nothing less. Rice, chicken, salad, additional side item and this time was tuna pasta salad? and miso soup. It was good. Just normal chicken katsu. Not so crispy this time. The portion is pretty big. My mom liked the udon. The broth was clear and light color, the tempuras came out on a separate plate. Tempuras were just ok. nnThe sushi was very disappointing but the rest was fine. I don't know if I'll comeback when I'm in town again.

I must now admit that I have some insight into the land of PF Chang's, considering I used to be an employee at a NY location. Let's all be serious here; it's a chain, the mcdonald's of chinese food. The kitchen just pumps the meals out, and you will notice that you can have anything on the menu sitting in front of you within 5 or 6 minutes, minus the chilean seabass. They are so busy, and spit the food out so fast, it just isn't the kind of place that you are going to get a quality meal. nnI do recommend the mongolian beef - the mongolian sauce is excellent. Just be prepared for your hands and feet to swell given the sodium levels in this thing - out of control. I also always get the ma po tofu - this was the dish that got me into tofu in the first place, considering I never used to be able to say the word 'tofu' without gagging. It's very tasty, a bit crispy, and in a spicy/garlicky sauce with steamed broccoli. A third and final recommendation is the lemon pepper shrimp - again, the sauce is what makes this dish. If you have room for dessert, do yourself a favor and order the banana spring rolls - it's a night ender, but so worth it! nnI didn't find any yucky bugs in my meal, but I will say this: I've worked in plenty of restaurants, fancy and not, and I've seen them everywhere - it is inevitable that roaches will infiltrate. It's pretty unavoidable.

Though I am not a wine drinker, it is pretty extensive. nnThe lunch menu is easy. Friendly for those craving sushi, burgers, noodle bowls and every other light lunchy option you could want. I'm a big fan of the seared tuna burger. The rare slices of tuna are divine. The bun is buttered and toasted on the flat top. Hellooooooo, lunch. So good. Bento boxes are an easy choice, too. They typically have a few different ones to choose from. nnBrunch, only on Sundays, is amazing. Wow. This is a force to be reckoned with. We made it in this past weekend for another spectacular experience. Quite the spread of tapas, prime rib, sushi, mac n' cheese, $5 mimosas (only after 12pm on Sundays), omelets, and enough desserts to make your teeth vibrate. We've gone several times and love the service, food, time to chat with friends and the overall vibe and atmosphere. All good things. nnUpstream does a fantastic job all around. Great staff, Chefs are incredibly talented and that Brunch.. .. . goodness. Always fun to visit! Cheers!",

This brunch is a monster of a buffet and tapas menu combined all for the low price of $25! Hold on you might be balking at the hefty sticker tag on this brunch but let me tell you about all the stuff you can well.. . stuff yourself with and you'll be singing praises too after you try this joint out. nnThis being one of my last weekends in Charlotte the boyfriend and I went with a yelpy crew consisting of Travis W., Melissa B., Chad E., And Denise. First off you walk in get greeted and led to your table and handed a nice tapas menu. They could've charged $7-10 for most of the items on this tapas menu and made a killing but nope they're giving it to you as part of the buffet, score! I tried the scallop risotto, crab benedict, belgian waffle, and some other things all excellent! But wait it doesn't stop there you walk into the bar area and BAM! you're hit with a massive buffet of brunch items. You want some smoked salmon and mushrooms folded into your freshly made omelet? No problem. Add some excellently carved prime rib onto that you got some good eats. I was so full before I even got halfway through working on this buffet. nnThis place has met my expectations for lunch, dinner, and now brunch. Hopefully I am back in Charlotte soon to give it another whirl. Though dinner is a bit expensive and they do need to tell you the prices of the specials lest you order a $45 bento box like I did, the staff is incredibly accomodating and attentive to your needs. Hell they even remembered my name and how I like my tea for lunch after the second time I was there! Give it a try, you can thank me later.",

Aside from that, the mass prepared food is pretty average. The breads and dessert are below average, since they are both dry and flavorless.

It was excellent, and arguably the best part of the meal. nnMy next course was the wood oven roasted Maine lobster. It was cut down the middle for me, and the claws were also cracked for me. Being a land lubber from the land of 10, 000 (freshwater) lakes, I don't have a ton of experience eating lobstah. Fortunately, I had a New Englander with me to show me the way. I understood that tail and claw meat was good, but I was unsure of what to eat in the middle. She told me that a real New Englander would eat the green stuff, which are eggs apparently. I tried them, but got a little too squeamish. I would have preferred to crack my own claws or at least get the claw-cracking utensil, as one of my claws couldn't be opened the rest of the way with my hands, but whatever. The lobster was okay.

The calamari was good too, but nothing to get too excited about as it  was pretty standard calamari. nnFor entrees, we all chose a different fish option from tuna, bass, halibut and black grouper. I had the grouper and it was a great dish. The menu describes it as \"Tim Griner's Line caught NC Black Grouper\" and the fish was definitely fresh and cooked to perfection. It was accompanied with local field peas, sweet corn, wood oven roasted tomatoes, bacon and a ramp vinaigrette. I would definitely order this plate again, unless one of the other fish or specials was calling my name. Service was good and certainly better than I have had in the past here.

The explanation I got was that the front struts didn't *need* to be replaced, but they recommended it because of the struts' age. That brought the total down to around $500. nnSo then I'm scratching my head wondering how the struts in the rear can be bad, because there's no noise or softness or weird bounce in the rear suspension (or the front, for that matter). My gut told me to get a second opinion. nnSo we took the car out east to my wife's regular family mechanic. He checks it out thoroughly, says the struts are all fine, replaces a bad wheel (a different one than that identified by Tire Kingdom), and balances/aligns all four wheels. nnAbout $280 later, the car drives great. nnNot sure what was going on at Tire Kingdom, maybe they just reached a bad diagnosis in good faith.

It can be bad because with room for only four pizzas at a time, and with one of those at any given time being a dessert pizza, it means if one of the three main pizzas isn't one that you like, you may have to wait for one that you like.

I don't know if this is because people don't like the choices of pizza and eat all the pasta, because they don't put much out, or some combination of both.

There is a good bit of marinara sauce, but I'm not sure what you're supposed to use it on, since the pizza has plenty and there is usually little pasta or bread.

But the normal prices for most beers are. 50 to $1. 50 too much. nWine-2. 0 I know it's a beer place, but sometimes people in your party don't like beer. nThe wine is overpriced, mediocre at best, and often has been open for days. nService- 4. 0Most the staff are cute and helpful but there is the occasional terrible service night. nAtmosphere- 3 Gets very loud at nights!

It is also true you always have to wait for the shuttle. I would see two Avis shuttle come and go and 10 or 15 mins later I will see the Hertz shuttle. I have also completed survey and sent in complaints to Hertz but nothing has changed. The only reason I have not switched is because of good services received at other cities and my assignment in Charlotte ends in Dec and I don't have to deal with Hertz CLT any more. nRichard.. . Thanks for your response. RR 543397190 has miles out 66, 900 (9/21/14) and miles in at 67, 054 (9/27)",

During my last visit, I decided to pony up the extra money and just buy a bottle of their vinegar based sauce to season the meat with. Even after all of that, it still wasn't very good. I recommend that they use more salt, pepper and vinegar when cooking the hog. nnWith that being said about the terrible BBQ, the rest of the food is actually pretty decent. I really like their fried chicken, coleslaw, potato salad and other dishes. I haven't tried the chicken and dumplings yet, but my friends say it's really good. nnThe staff is always friendly and attentive and I really like the comical signs that they have outside. I'd recommend this place for fried chicken and good sides, but I can't give the thumbs up to anyone regarding their eastern chopped barbecue.",

I was greeted by a stark showroom filled with dusty baskets and props that looked like they belonged in a family photo studio circa 1981. The two small refrigerators they did have only had 4 bouquets in them, and the flowers appeared old and wilted. The employee pointed to the cooler at what I believed to be the \"Charlie Brown Christmas Tree\" of floral arrangements and informed me the arrangements start at $45 and go up from there. nnThe employee did rise quickly to greet me, she asked if I needed help. I inquired about delivery, and they do deliver, which is nice. She was more than willing to help me out, but the combination of a boring showroom, shabby product and high prices just left me standing there staring at the employee. I couldn't even make up a lie as to why I needed to leave, I just blurted out \"I'm going to try somewhere else\" and turned and walked out. nnI ended up going to an unnamed local grocery store in Charlotte and a florist working in the smallest little corner of the store made me a really large arrangement with fall colors for around $35. This was definitely a case where I wanted to support local business but the product they offered completely underwhelmed me. nnTodd's Flowers has a good location with some really nice Elizabeth homes nearby, but they need to work on the customer experience, and they need to have someone cranking out beautiful arrangements that you can't find anywhere else in that area.

The food here is good and it's probably one of the places in Charlotte you have to eat, but I will return to other places before returning to Barrington's. nnAfter all of the talk about how good the food is at Barrington's, we had admittedly high expectations. To begin with, we were both fairly disappointed with the bread served prior to our meal. I generally think that, while not a significant part of the meal, the bread sets the tone for a meal. Ours tasted and felt like it was either microwaved or warmed in a convection oven. Of all of the really good meals I have had in my life, I would venture than 95% were proceeded by exceptional bread. nnI thought the tomato soup was very, very good. My wife had a mixed green salad that was good but not exceptional. The entrees were the biggest disappointment. I ordered the lamb chops. This was, again, a good dish but not exceptional. I am a fan of keeping food simple. The hash and greens ended up just being a mix of flavors that didn't necessarily complement the meat. I also love a good sear to the outside of the meat to provide texture, which this preparation lacked. nnMy wife had the rigatoni. This a very rich and abundant dish. I can see what it is popular but think that better pastas can be had at a number of restaurants in Charlotte. nnOverall, we had a good experience. It definitely suffered from our high expectations, but I would not rank this as Charlotte's best restaurant largely due to my feeling that it wasn't very innovative, the lamb could have been prepared a little better and the rigatoni was just a decadent but not necessarily tasty dish.",

This section alone is larger than many sports bars these days, and it looks even larger because it's open, rather than being cramped and confined. While there did not seem to be any smokiness to the area, there could have been some. It was definitely loud, as most any bar will be on this sort of night. nnNext, you have a dining section, which wouldn't be much different than any other family-style dining area, except for the fact that it was right next to the bar. So if you take the family, you'll want to be aware of this. It's not exactly set up for a quiet night out, even on the calmest of times, and this certainly wasn't that. nnThe good news for older crowds (those without younger kids) is that if you're waiting for a table, you can wait in the bar section. They also have these very long tables that run the length of the bar area, and you can even eat there if you don't mind the crowd. We didn't really feel like waiting, and since the whole building had a sort of bar feel to it, felt like it really didn't matter. nnIn the end, it didn't. The only problem with this was getting the attention of a waitress. Once we did, service went along fairly well, though getting refills was a bit slow. nnThe food was good, and priced decently, but appetizers were expensive, as can be expected in most bars.

The veggies always seem really fresh and the selection is different than what you'll see anywhere else. For example, the WonTon soup has some fresh spinach leaves in it. Have you ever seen that done anywhere? I haven't, but the flavor it imparts is impeccable. Vegetable fried rice includes big pieces of fresh red pepper, yellow squash, and asparagus. And while some of the other dishes can be oversauced, the fried rice has a lot less sauce than any other place.. . and that allows the incredible flavor of these fresh veggies to glide delectably over your tastebuds. nnIt is a little more expensive than your typical Chinese restaurant, but it's worth it!",

If you like Americanized Chinese you will be delighted as it was certainly a cut above most with that sort of menu. I, on the other hand, love Chinese cuisine and even cook it extensively at home and do not appreciate the hybridization so much. I ordered the tofu vegetable soup, pork dumplings, gai lan with oyster sauce, eggplant in garlic sauce, and the steamed basa in black bean sauce. The soup had a nice chicken broth but the tofu was lacking, just a couple slivers. The vegetables in the soup were a frozen medley* variety with the processed baby carrots, snow peas, and cauliflower. The pork dumplings were certainly made in house and quite good. The gai lan with oyster sauce was actually shanghi tips (baby bok choy) with a thin brown sauce that was quite light in flavor and a sprinkling of jarred minced garlic ontop, not what we ordered (or on the menu as we could tell). The eggplant in garlic sauce came to the table as eggplant with a szechuan style sweet and sour sauce. The fish came to the table as a steamed fillet on a plate with the same frozen vegetable* ontop except the medley was peppers, onions, carrot, broccoli. The sauce was not radically different than the sauce accompanying the shanghi tips with the addition of a sprinkling of fermented black beans in lieu of the garlic. We gobbled it up, afterall it was Thanksgiving for these out-of-towners, and it wasn't bad.

There is another eating area and a bar that have standard ceiling height. There are two types of seating. One is square tables, with white table clothes, and the other is padded benches with outdated mauve tables. Very Denny-ish or like a local diner. They benches were in great shape, but the tables were a little worn around the edges. The table was stocked with a plain salt-and-pepper set and a plain sugar holder. The floor was carpeted, which I only mention because, unless carpeting looks very clean, I view it as a breeding ground for bacteria.

        "content": "but I choose a 4 and I'll tell you why in a second. nnI came with friends a few Sundays ago and I fell in love with this type of buffet-I generally equate buffets with Golden Corral and run the other way. For a newbie to Indian food, its great to be able to try a little bit of everything. If you love food that uses a variety of spices in unusual combinations (not necessarily spicy as in hot), Bombay Grille provides a nice introduction to Indian food. nnThe buffet is small-ish and usually has several chicken dishes-butter chicken, curried chicken, and chicken vindaloo among others. The sauces are out-of-this-world delicious and even the paneer (Indian tofu) has a bouncy texture. The buffet includes fresh naan brought to your table, which you can dip in the delicious sauces from the entrees. They have a strange looking dish that is chopped spinach, mint, and chickpeas-looks like baby poo but tastes delicious! nnThe reason that this place deserves 4 stars is the mango custard desert. It is creamy. delicious, and helps cool off my over-spiced American palate after a spicy meal. I would bathe in this stuff if I could!! ! Be sure to save room for dessert. nnTip: The Sunday buffet is more expensive ($12), so try it during the week if you're budget-conscious.",

        "content": "I give it a three, but my heart says that they deserve a two-star rating. nnBiggest reason is the cost. For Indian food paying $8 - 10 for a simple curry is a lot and when you add additional rice, their portion for accompanying rice is skimpy, nan bread you are into a $20+ meal and then add a beverage, esp an Indian lager, you get a bill for a couple of nearly $60. nnOut take-out orders are at or over $100. So we have cut down. nnThe lunch buffet is skimpy as well. After the first rush of diners many of the courses offered are gone or near gone. There is quite a wait and it takes a number of people asking for more to roust management and the kitchen to put it out. And the selections are not much variety-wise and on the cheap end of their menu. nnThe buffet might be dollar-cheap, but you get what you pay for:  not so good. nnDining in, which we thought would be a nicer experience and better portions than take-out, turned out to just be the same niggardly fare. nnThe tastes and quality of the goods appears to have remained consistently good, but we are disappointed at the prices, lackadaisical buffet and skimpy portions.",

It  looked like it might be crowded with all the cars in the parking lot but when we got in the restaurant was bigger than it looks and it didn't feel cramped at all. Another surprise is apparently Sunday's they just do a buffet. nnThe inside was your typical American-Chinese restaurant look with the brass bars, and large fish tanks and a bit of flair from the 80's. One thing that stuck out like a sore thumb is the absence of sound. It honestly felt like family dinner time after report cards came out. Besides the occasional cough and banging of fork on the plate that was it. My wife and I actually felt uncomfortable holding a conversation above a faint whisper. Don't know what the deal was with that maybe the other customers were regulars and were used to the \"no talking while you eat\". nnThe food was average. It was a relatively small buffet, featuring two types of rice, some noodles, sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, chicken wings, and about 5 variations of chicken, cashews, and sauce. I will say the egg rolls were the size of hot pockets and tasted like had been either fried way to long or they were using old oil. The sesame chicken was crispy which was nice but the sauce tasted like it was just poured out of a drum. Nothing to write home about. At least the service was good. I noticed on someone else's review, they mentioned the service is a little over bearing at times. I couldn't take a sip of tea with out him trying to refill it. All in all it was a very bland an QUIET lunch. Maybe since it was on a Sunday the food was a little below par, I'll have to try it again and order off the menu and see how it goes.",

My entru00e9e,  if I still have room will be garlic prawns and sea scallops. My wife will be having #63. nnWell we ate our way through the appetizers.. . Did anything stand out you might ask. The answer surprised even me. I never thought that Thai food was supposed to not have any flavor. I never knew that it was simply a platform for the sauces,  very disappointing. The Tod mun for example was described as a blend of ground fish and best Thai spices. It had no flavor that stood out except for a slightly fishy aftertaste. It was simply a base for the sauce that accompanied it. nNow the entru00e9e,  garlic prawns and sea scallops.. . Prawns to me are seriously large shrimp bordering on the size of young lobsters. At the very least they should be as large as the shrimp that you would get in a shrimp cocktail at a nice restaurant. Sea scallops are fat and juicy with a diameter akin to a half dollar coin. What appeared on the plate were a lot of vegetables, shrimp the size of ones that you'd buy in a bag at HT and tiny scallops. There were more veggies than seafood. Bummer. I couldn't taste any garlic in the dish and asked for some garlic on the side. I guess all my time with Peter Pan made me believe that I would be given a dish of either raw or roasted garlic instead I was given a small bowl of dry garlic bits. nThe only things that saved the meal from being a complete disappointment were the company, the Thai ice tea and the mango with sticky rice for dessert. If I decide to eat here again I really need to review my reviews and order nothing but the Thai ice tea and the mango and sticky rice.",

It took another 30-45 minutes to get our food and then another 10-15 to get bill and checked out. Almost 2 hours is way to long for a meal, especially when it's impossible to have any sort of conversation with the others in your party. nSo I believe over the years i've tried TGIF's 3 times or so and I'm pretty sure this will be the last time.

Since we were hungry, we walked out of the restaurant, and one of the workers started waving us down because they had an opened table. The sad part?

Through out the night, it was hard to find her or get her attention because she would pass by our table.

We both had salads which seemed to be extremely small and were made with ingredients that were close to their expiration date (limp lettuce, slimy tomatoes, and old cheese).

Given the ratio of waitresses to customers, one would expect the service to be more prompt, but it wasn't. The food also seemed to take a really long time to come out, about 45 mins for a steak with fries and riblets with fries, it may have actually been closer to an hour. nnIf you're in the area and in a bind to find something to eat, I recommend that you either find somewhere else to go or just save your money and hit one of the local grocery stores.

The vet tech came very quickly, and she was very good to my dog. Then I met Dr. Hodges. She is SUCH an amazing vet! She was so good with both my animals and me. She does a great job of answering questions, and she's really into alternative medicine for animals. While I was spazzing out because my dog was sick, she really helped to assuage my concerns. nnOne time I was able to bring my dog immediately in for an emergency appointment. It ended up being nothing serious, but she personally saw him about 5 minutes after we arrived. The emergency visit was the same price as the regular office visit (although it was probably because it was during hours). nnOne of my other favorite things is that Dr. Hodges calls me personally with the results of any testing and to check up on the animals after they've had an appointment. It reminds me of my previous vet, and I really like that she gives great, practical, and easy-to-understand information. nnThe only complaint I have is that the prices are a little high (it's $58 for an office visit). They might just be the standard cost for a vet visit here in Charlotte, but I have no idea since this is the only vet I've used here. Nevertheless, they take such good care of my boys, it's totally worth it.

We did take another of our dogs there a couple of times, but she was smaller, and so we'd typically do her hair ourselves. nnThe others either didn't need cutting - ever - or are so small that it's just not worth it. But for the larger dogs that take too long or are too difficult for us to control? It's absolutely worth having someone else do. That's when you need a professional, and they take care of them. nnOn the down side of things, they are a bit pricey. For a bath and a cut (or a cut and a bath, I have no idea which order they do it), it would be $70, and that was some time ago. It's nice to not have to do it, but we couldn't afford to do it very often. Great job, he looked great, but man that was expensive!",

It's understandably a busy time of day for people to pop into the grocery store, but it seems as though this Pick 'n Save refuses to adjust its staffing needs appropriately. Like another reviewer pointed out, very basic produce (basically, anything green) is often wilty, slimey and/or brown. I pointed this out to a produce worker once and asked if they had anything more fresh and he went to the back for better lettuce. .. which was only slightly better than what was out. nnThe prices, however, are my biggest beef. For example, an avocado at Woodman's is $. 69-. 79 each, whereas at Pick 'n Save, they are $1. 69-1. 79 each. Now and then they run a sale: 2 for $3. Whoa! The savings! HA. A 96 oz. bottle of Welch's grape juice costs $6. 19 at Pick 'n Save; at Woodman's the same bottle costs about $3. 59. A container of heavy whipping cream is double the cost of the same size whipping cream at Woodman's. A Palermo's Thin Crust pizza is $6-7 at Pick 'n Save; 2 for $10 at Woodman's (although they have been running an occasional sale at PNS with BOGO on the Palermo's, making them an excellent deal). Small carving pumpkins: $3. 99 at Pick 'n Save, HUGE-ASS carving pumpkins at Woodman's were $3. 49. And on and on. If you're on a grocery budget, Pick 'n Save makes saving money and getting good buys a major battle of the wits with its customers. You've got the Fresh Perks card, some sort of e-coupon option, etc.. .. hey, how about you just lower your frickin' prices?? nnDespite being 5 minutes from my house, I plan my grocery shopping so that I only have to shop there in a pinch.

They said they couldn't do anything better than their listed rate. nAfter that I decided to downgrade to their lowest speed for the time being in order to save some money. When I called up to do so they transferred me to retentions and magically they offered me a better rate. Turned out they were lying and there was an additional charge on top of that because I wasn't bundling serviced (I have no interest in rotting my brain out watching cable TV or having a phone that I can't take with me in my pocket), when I complained and asked for the original rate the supervisor did not apologize and said the last person I talked to must have assumed I knew about the extra fee. When I told her I wanted the original rate she said there was nothing she could do, what is the point of having a retentions department if the best they can do is what is listed on the website? nFinally I organized DSL with AT&T which was simple and easy and did not require a visit for installation. I just plugged the DSL modem in and called customer service who guided me through the set up. When I called to cancel with Charter they offered me the original rate but I'm pretty sure it would have been the same thing again.

        "content": "We had just purchased it earlier that year. It was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty. We called Acura Roadside Assistance and they sent out a tow truck that jumped us so that we could drive to the nearest dealer to have the car looked at and fixed. The closest Acura dealer was Zimbrick of Middleton and we dealt with Shane (the manager) in the service department. They replaced the battery in our car and then informed us that our car now had a check engine light on. We asked if they could pull the codes and tell us what was wrong or even clear them and see if they came back. He told us that we would have to take the car in its current condition with the light on because he said, \"It's the day after Christmas and I just don't have the manpower to deal with it. \". My Husband reiterated to Shane that he please just pull the codes so that we have an idea of what we were dealing with, Shane refused. We were worried about taking the car as we were traveling from Minneapolis to Chicago and it already broke down on us once. Plus, with the delay of the battery ordeal we'd be getting into Chicago during rush hour. We decided to cancel our hotel reservation that we had for that night in Chicago and called Acura of Brookfield. They said they could get us in first thing the next morning to scan it and see why there was a check engine light on. So we spent the night in Brookfield and that dealer took great care of us! They even reserved a rental car in case it was needed. I just wish that's who we would've went to first. Oh, and I forgot to mention earlier.. . Zimbrick of Middleton put a three inch black scuff on the drivers side rear quarter panel of our white car while it was in the shop. When we noticed it and went in to ask Shane to take a look at it he became extremely short with us and was down right rude. He implied to us that it was there from before and it clearly was not. His level of customer service was appalling.",

I have come here for every little item I needed done and have never felt cheated or had the blanket pulled over my eyes. There have been a few things where I was expecting a HUGE bill for things like the stabilizer for my rear suspension that had been slightly bent. I bought a new one and brought it in thinking well Labor will be $100. Zimbrick got me right in, said it would take an hour, had it out in half an hour and didn't charge me a dime. Another time I have come in expecting to replace all my breaks and rotors and Zimbrick saved me about $300 without having to replace everything. nnI have worked with a few guys here and they have ALL been extremely professional and treated me like family. The guy I usually go to even just chats with me about cars and such while i'm having service done. (Mainly getting my oil changed). The facility itself is nothing less than perfection, in my opinion, when it comes to dealerships. It is clean, well layed out, they have a great lounge with a Big Screen TV, leather chairs, FREE WIFI, and the best of all.. . Free Starbucks Coffee. I have had nothing but great experiences from Zimbrick and not just Zimbrick Acura. However, BECAUSE of Zimbrick Acura I expect to buy another Acura and stay with them for a VERY very long time. Thank you Zimbrick Acura! YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST. nnP. S. When I was having major service done they let me choose what I wanted to drive while I waited for the day. NOBODY does that.

After one of the three employees rung me up, I waited several minutes as the barista VERY leisurely made the person in front of me's cappucino. She was literally pulling an espresso, standing for a few seconds talking to the other girl, then steaming the milk, then standing, and so on. nnAfter she finally finished the other guy's drink, she wiped her area down and took her sweet time to start my drink.

(No sugar coating, that's almost verbatim what he said. ) For the record, I wasn't actually using their wi-fi, I was writing. Whatever. His point was obvious. I stared at him for a few seconds because I couldn't believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when I had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. He suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded I should get out. I said that if that's how they felt I would leave now, and he responded, \"That's exactly how we feel. \" I was shocked, and still am. I have never, NEVER been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. And I'm a regular, paying customer!! I always leave a tip! I still can't believe I was treated this way. nnI will no longer recommend this place, now that they've shown their true colors.

Also, hey brilliant idea guys, put the pool across the hall from the elevator and then make that whole area tile so people track water out and the floor is slippery! Nice.

Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints. Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff. It greatly lacks attention to detail.

I then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out. All of the power in the room was then knocked out. This is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous. I was lucky my computer was not fried. The last straw came when I killed a large fly in the room with the first thing I could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu. I then crumpled the menu and threw it away. The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow. I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up. Outrageous. Anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind. I will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers.

        "content": "I'll briefly break down how I gauge them (I've been many times, both before and after the renovation)nnFacility:  Great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with TVs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments. nnCost:  Fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, I think it's around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes. I'm sure it's hiked up otherwise. Open Bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option. We used to go on Thursdays which seems to be a good night for them. nnFood:  It's typical bar food. They have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you'd see at an alley. Nothing to write home about but if you're in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won't go wrong. nnService:  I cannot stand the people that work at the counter. There's a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you're there. Everytime I've gone in I've tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like \"I'd like to get a lane, there's 3 of us and we all need shoes\" etc, etc. These guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn't help either party move the process along. It's really irritating because I've gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it's always been like that. The bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don't share the same attitude. nnPersonally I'm more of a Schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so Sport Bowl sometimes wins out.",

I'll give them the +1 for appearances. nn-2 stars: The food is terrible. TERRIBLE. After the WIS v UTEP game, the wife ordered boneless Buffalo chicken wings. They came out deep fried and hard, with almost no flavor -- there was NO BUFFALO SAUCE ON THE WINGS! (We think the B-sauce might have been fried onto the chicken, but, if so, the flavor was lost in frying). nn-1 star: The service was lacking.

Service was slow, haphazard, and careless -- the guy never once asked how the food was, nor did he ever actually stop at the table except long enough to take our order.

Worse yet, after staring at the screen as it read \"Transaction Processing\" for 6-minutes, the ATM failed to work.

My mom got the ribs and although a bit lathered in sauce for me, she loved it. nnI did enjoy the salad bar, for a day that was probably not so busy - it was well kept and everything seemed very fresh. The waitress also brought out a loaf of hot fresh baked (or at least warmed) bread. Call me old fashioned, but I loved this. Very good bread and a nice touch to a meal. nnOverall, everything was decent even if the portions were a bit small for the price.
