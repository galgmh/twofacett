Allnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well asall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid atnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space isspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement isdemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made formore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown fordistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large HadronCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgsboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showingthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judiciousselection of events.",

        "abstract": "The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter fieldfluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agreeswith this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of theMoon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossilevidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggeststhat the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of theEarth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived fromEarth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predictsthat the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rateabout -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).",

These objectsexhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit withactively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possiblydebris disks.

Spin-modulated radialvelocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the firsttime in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at theouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretioncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Dopplertomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extendingfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed thetheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) andNorton et al.

Evidencefor overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya ispresent during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta andhgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at theouter disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow ofmaterial along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) andclose to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with theaccretion curtain model.",

We construct an approximation to thestochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back tothe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies inthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after theirdeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integrationschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlyingordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by atruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie groupintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinarydifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods areuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigidbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed bytwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.",

Computations carried outwith a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlssonand Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive todynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to lookfor dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggeststhat high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided byALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the coolgas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models ofthe solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations ofthe quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) revealsignificant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longerperiods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as thatprovided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the featureswithin the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output ofthe comprehensive dynamic simulations.",

The relative importance of the linear termdecreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enoughscatterers is quadratic in the common range of d.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be convertedinto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETICCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space andvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each ofthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematicallyreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above theion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenicfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisionaland collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associatedwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion andelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passivephase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings theenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionlesswave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in thephase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at theelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scalingrelations are derived for these cascades.

In particular, it is shown that the combined action ofvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain globalrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of theleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolatedsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude.

The paracommutation relations or some theirgeneralizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validityof all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenbergequations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem issolved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normalordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That impliescorresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introductionof the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutationrelations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variablesis reduced to normal ordering.

Spatial order and size order of SAQDs areimportant to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these twotypes of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will alsohave strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order isundertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formationbased on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlationfunctions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order andcorresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scalerandom fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about twodots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, thecorrelation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-criticalfilm height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy andSAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering withcorresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its naturea stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statisticalanalysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.",

We prove aresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the termsof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finitedimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariantsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomologicalclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a giventype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classesand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have aplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents isimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growthrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class givessufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of anyother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamicalsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we giveconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheafcontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheafcohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identifiedwith the deRham cohomology groups.

We arguethat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function thatinitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporationdriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between theobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, centralconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model inwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-knowninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significantvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-drivencluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to dependinstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidalradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternativeprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable asrho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMFimplies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values(although falling towards the low end of this range).

We considerlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can beneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with anadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. Weemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationaryanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. Thesesolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up ina finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowupssignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-uptime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ whilethe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shockdiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at thesingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gaspressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in timeclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the densityblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which thehydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of theexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solvingthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutionsshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions.",

According to this property thespace-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of fieldconfigurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all thepp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for thebackground scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorialfields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shellpp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universalsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive tothe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such resultscan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We alsostudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). Inparticular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transversespace and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinitionrelating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massivemodes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of thissimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified onthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, aniterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFTequations of motion has been discussed.

Asthe nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams revealstriking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresisloops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivitydistribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with acalculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nmnanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of thevortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution andconfirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method givesquantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleationand annihilation fields.",

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spina=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbitswhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respectto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact oppositeto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was notedpreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close tothe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysisgeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbitsreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimmingorbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorialconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growingorbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorialconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that theearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearlyhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxesbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and toequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also foreccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclinationchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits arenot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveformsexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.",

The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique isinvoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while thetransfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explorethe thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlationfunctions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state forthe three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaksat wavevectors $q=a\\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zeromagnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetizationplateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\\pi /3$ and$4\\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent.

        "abstract": "In the SK analysis of the neutrino events for [Fully Contained Events] and[Partially Contained Events] on their zenith angle distribution, it is assumedthat the zenith angle of the incident neutrino is the same as that of thedetected charged lepton. In the present paper, we examine the validity of [theSK assumption on the direction] of the incident neutrinos. Concretely speaking,we analyze muon-like events due to QEL. For the purpose, we develop [TimeSequential Monte Carlo Simulation] to extract the conclusion on the validity ofthe SK assumption. In our [Time Sequential Simulation], we simulate everyphysical process concerned as exactly as possible without any approximation.  From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muonsunder [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtainedunder our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement ofthe direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring insidethe detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holdsirrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.",

        "abstract": "A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a ratherunexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knotsare extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to proteinfunction in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete ProteinData Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discoveredones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the mostcomplex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest thatits entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by theproteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species andsometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which onlyappears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins ofsimilar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in theenzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of ashort DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into aknotted structure in this protein.",

We foundthat in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates aredirectly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relationholds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuatingenvironment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship nolonger holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold eitherin the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action.

The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources afteraccounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer censusof IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatiallywith the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster arounda B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster peripheryabout 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We findthat the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with thatrate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar populationindicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show thatthe IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by itssmooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. Whileit seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result ofdynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findingssupport a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smallersub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that thesupposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud shouldnot preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.",

Here we analyze the performance ofRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selectedfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributedentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to thetransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity ofbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large systemrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all goto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. Theperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalarquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a randomsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, andapproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples showthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-sizesystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examplesshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is onlyslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matchedfilter can require significantly more feedback.",

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subclusterwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions ofthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionlessgalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on theself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, usingsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, andcomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow fora new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observationof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. Thisnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. Ifwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equalmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringentconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of thesubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with theuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of darkmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slightimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules outmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between thestandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.",

The spectral energydistribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, withflux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the veryhigh energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jetmodel to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during ourmultiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproducethe observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff valuefor the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth dueto the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of thehigh-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presenceof a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important rolein the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close tothe central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray andgamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Comptonemission.

Aims: This motivates planet searches aroundstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and inparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internalerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersionis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where eachplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day periodcoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates ina spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on theother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detectionadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, andreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populatedthan the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarfwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawnfrom the same parent distribution.

However, attempts to reconstructthe evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven moreproblematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, eitherduring the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced thefirst white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, commonenvelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massivewhite dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presentsinterpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelopeevolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usualformulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution.

We find that the overall binary fraction of acluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at latetimes when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in thecentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a corebinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed inthe core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination ofmass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions producesthe observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycledinto and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection instars.

A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedlesscone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The onlyexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making itunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading tocode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpointimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of ananalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton andhadron levels.

We use anelaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles thanearlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the centralregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of aslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by acentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant thatmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamicstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellarevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled byneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, andthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effectiveaccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretionof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of doubleCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply thatat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered goodcandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.

        "abstract": "For the past two decades, single-index model, a special case of projectionpursuit regression, has proven to be an efficient way of coping with the highdimensional problem in nonparametric regression. In this paper, based on weaklydependent sample, we investigate the single-index prediction (SIP) model whichis robust against deviation from the single-index model. The single-index isidentified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function ofthe response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is agenuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed forthe single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistentand asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which issufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension withinseconds. Simulation experiments have provided strong evidence that corroborateswith the asymptotic theory. Application of the proposed procedure to the riveflow data of Iceland has yielded superior out-of-sample rolling forecasts.",

        "abstract": "Air fluorescence detectors measure the energy of ultra-high energy cosmicrays by collecting fluorescence light emitted from nitrogen molecules along theextensive air shower cascade. To ensure a reliable energy determination, thelight signal needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, which not onlyattenuate the signal, but also produce a non-negligible background componentdue to scattered Cherenkov light and multiple-scattered light. The correctionrequires regular measurements of the aerosol attenuation length and the aerosolphase function, defined as the probability of light scattered in a givendirection. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phasefunction is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF)light sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view ofthe fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the imageof the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes thedesign, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of theAPF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.",

        "abstract": "Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes intheir protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from thecircumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks hasbeen unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of theouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting inaccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifestitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present asearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopicbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find thatthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. Thebrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overallperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more thanhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not asclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic componentis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement withpredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar tothose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur fromcircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending thetimescale over which they might form planets.",

In this paper, we introduce a new type ofnetwork growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and proposean evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on networkstructure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, networkstructure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution ofthe network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as theintensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivialdisassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result ofnetwork evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deletingintroduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing networkso long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-worldeffect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clusteringcoefficient in a network.",

The observational simplicity of our approach, and the directmeasurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, forboth elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes itstraightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-typegalaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass functionwith a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxysample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, andintegrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the localmass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-typegalaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}.

The conclusions do not depend on the particular shapesof the potentials and can be important in different fields of physics. Whenboth scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions forisospectrality imply that the spin-orbit and Darwin terms of either the uppercomponent or the lower component of the Dirac spinor vanish, making itequivalent, as far as energy is concerned, to a spin-0 state. In this case,besides energy, a scalar particle will also have the same orbital angularmomentum as the (conserved) orbital angular momentum of either the upper orlower component of the corresponding spin-1/2 particle.

In analysesundertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distancemeasurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from diskobjects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halodark matter residing in such objects.  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo whitedwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed thestars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determinedyielding relative errors on distances of $\\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\\sim12$% for3 objects, and $\\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be toodistant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in ourobservations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities werederived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halomembership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may bethick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion basedsolely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometricparallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance asderived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revisethe halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in asubsequent publication.",

This may have implicationsfor gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as corecollapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,performed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such lowT/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in thenonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, whichshow that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside thecorotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-modedeformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation areconfirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays animportant role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,which has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainableamplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.",

Theseeffects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlyingtopology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that isdescribed by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe thismodel is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend onthe details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution ofa system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processesthrough two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of populationstructure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: theeffective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of localdynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of acontinuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populationswith hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratiobecomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatialstructure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel andcounterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustainscooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner'sdilemma and also of the \"rock-paper-scissor\" game we find indications of richstructure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other modelswith explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity andthe emergence of global oscillations.",

We estimate theimpact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in thefirst galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II andPop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces theformation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x isthe mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photonsthat escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity andk_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.By the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-photodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, theprimordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.",

By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze thesimplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions thatthe spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions aregeodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes).

We carried out spectroscopic observationsof this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Ourspectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitoredsince December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS withinthis period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with aperiod of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period ofthis variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teffvariation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlationbetween the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude therotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of thelong-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-masscompanion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radialvelocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the hoststar, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, whichlies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4.

Thisimplies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescaleof hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during theobservation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines aregenerally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in thebinary system.

In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourthGalactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise inthe Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directedcounter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm.

A model in which thedust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperaturesaccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as amodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperaturesaccording to distance.

        "abstract": "We observe a sharp transition from a singular, high-mass mode of starformation, to a low-mass dominated mode, in numerical simulations, at ametallicity of 10^-3 Zsolar. We incorporate a new method for including theradiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamicsimulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,led to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, tothe low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations withcosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, withmetallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. Thesimulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar corereveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4Zsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two withmetallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that sharemost of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-massproto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lowerlimit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the secondgeneration stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still moremassive on average than stars formed in the local universe.",

        "abstract": "We use high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy from Keck Observatory tomeasure the stellar velocity dispersions of 19 super star clusters (SSCs) inthe nuclear starburst of M82. The clusters have ages on the order of 10 Myr,which is many times longer than the crossing times implied by their velocitydispersions and radii. We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to derive thekinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6solar masses, with a total population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses.Comparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globularclusters in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that the SSCsare a population of potential globular clusters. We present the mass functionfor the SSCs, and find a power law fit with an index of gamma = -1.91 +/- 0.06.This result is nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in theAntennae galaxies.",

Here we show that these GCs withextended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated byrandom motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the innerhalo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to theformation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematicproperties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretionorigin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and weanticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations ofMilky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.",

The skeletons arecomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form acompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices oftriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, aninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength insidethe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phasesmentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bendingrigidity regime that was not studied here.

We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in termsof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithmruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm thatruns in polynomial time.

The simple approximation is equivalent toan extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonizedby prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximationis capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. Thepair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence ofprey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time andanother displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the populationdensities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise througha Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditionsand, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend oninitial conditions.

The observations resolved thehot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatialresolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them locatedwithin 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellardensities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3.

We find interesting chemical spatialdifferentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhancedat the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperaturesensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. TheSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from thishot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hotcore and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons forthat are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the mainsubmm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to thelarge-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of thecentral protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk.

This paper introduces the notion of \"canonicalnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacitiescan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that thethroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upperbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are manyhops away.

Our simulations show that 802.11 networks withrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs farbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near thegateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) tofashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can beimproved significantly by more than 150%.

We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globularclusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al.

        "abstract": "The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to acommunication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with theirrespective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of thesenders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the messagebeing transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively hasadvantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding,is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme,achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussiancases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rateregions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in thehigh-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offerconsiderable improvements over these existing results.",

        "abstract": "IGR J11215-5952 is a hard X-ray transient source discovered in April 2005with INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-rayBinaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL dataand RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodicoutbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target ofOpportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the sourcebehaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. Thesource field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4thFebruary, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposureof ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from aSFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbedpower law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peakluminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance ofthe optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for anoutburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almostquiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previouslythought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only thebrightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothlyincreasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbitwith many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneousaccretion.",

The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low densitylimit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths andignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs havelower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with lineflux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue thatdifferential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust inthe obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limitand we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of thetorus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount ofextinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the lineratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densitiesassociated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. Wealso find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extendedand originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission fromlow-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios fromsuch species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearbygalaxies.",

With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generatorsnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously brokenas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only onegenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosonsrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangementof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remainstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theoryinvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turnout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gaugeinvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation couldbecome directly observable at low energies.",

However, the $(\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+})$- and$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of theinelastic cross sections.

The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlapbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume.

        "abstract": "We present new multi-wavelength millimeter interferometric observations ofthe Herbig Ae star HD 163296 obtained with the IRAM/PBI, SMA and VLA arraysboth in continuum and in the 12CO, 13CO and C18O emission lines. Gas and dustproperties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistentdisk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolvedboth in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellarmaterial is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The diskinclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a positionangle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7mm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust andCO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,we obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 isstrongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion ofdust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration oflarge bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in thedust distribution by a low mass companion.",

Cluster analysis of Stokes V profilepairs shows that the two lines, despite arguably being formed fairly close,often do not have similar shapes. In the network, the local magnetic topologyis more important in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than thephase of the wave, contrary to what our simulations show. We also find thatStokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms of theobserved amplitude and area asymmetries differ significantly from thesimulation. Both the network and internetwork show oscillatory behavior in theCa II lines. It is stronger in the network, where shocking waves, similar tothose in the high-beta simulation, are seen and large self-reversals in theintensity profiles are common.",

While the variation of $\\mu$ can shift theprospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) byabout Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stablewith respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters.

The steerablewavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one todefine three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation betweenthe WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. Themost significant detection is obtained in the correlation of thesigned-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspectingsigned-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see thecorrelation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination andinstrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of allsignificant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on theISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation inducedbetween the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of theUniverse. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, ourdetection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence fordark energy.

We present anew planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towardsboth of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that isable to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planettransits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the timebetween transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to inferthe orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a massthat is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection techniquecomplements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motionresonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reducedsensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded thephotometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTVplanet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number ofhigh-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existingtelescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transitingplanets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\\sim 0.5{\\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramaticallyincrease the effectiveness of transit timing observations.",

We demonstrate that the procedure allowsus to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably withheight, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even forloops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loopsare below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find thatsmall-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due toimperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur inespecially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially brightrelative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact theability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops donot expand systematically with height is robust.",

Forthe gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to anextremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}.

Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficientsof the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Thosecoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioraldynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has beenstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms ofexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy inclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy hasbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network andproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may evenbe impossible to implement.

We find thatthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the densefilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorptionnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. Wealso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close togalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around thegalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metalabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models withoutfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIVand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the meantransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forminggalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI isindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOSwith lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback canproduce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We concludethat OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.",

On the other hand, helium starsin close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite thestrong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retainsufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.",

        "abstract": "When the DNA double helix is subjected to external forces it can stretchelastically to elongations reaching 100% of its natural length. Thesedistortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramaticeffect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transportalong DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture theelectronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, webegin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronicstates in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurationsencountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results arecomplemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the statesof a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronicstates are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that candescribe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as thepresence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of thesubstrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian whichleads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by severalorders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretchedstructure.",

Such a dynamical evolution process is includedhere in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function oftransverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC andLHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in thepartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonicchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then theydissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occursvia two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octetccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There aremodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through thereactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large averagemomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermalstage at LHC energy.

Consequently, abulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution andthe ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleoncollisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus anindicator of a deconfined partonic medium.

Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliablespectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations ofits associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminousstar of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar massesand an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSXobservations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of thesky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matcheswell the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its pathacross the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densestregion of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runawaystars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2.

This inverse problem - known as electricalimpedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence hasfocussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,no work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paperaims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivativeof the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface$\\partial\\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover thegeometry of $\\partial \\omega$ and derive the expression of the derivativesneeded to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate thestability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severelyill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.",

In such an orbit,we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particlemotion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for afinite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how thesedifferent chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, weinvestigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find thatsuch a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energyspectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite differentfrom that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion.

The low radio fluxemitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard stateinterpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) issimilar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that atwhich the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really doeshave a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGNand GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present animproved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based onconsiderably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits ofcontinuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, wellfitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit byadding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is notunusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a secondbreak at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rateimplies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency foundin NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with otherAGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.",

The sampling process in nearly allcases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on aper-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on thecollected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significantfor some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relativeaccuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage ofsampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to theoriginal traffic stream.

Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical andKs-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs aremodeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (usingthe phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associatedwith passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of redquasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation areused to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the blackholes residing in these AGN.  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)bands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observednear- and mid-infrared data.

Entanglement is at theheart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and forapplications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,entanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairsA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-StateMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangledstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any commonpast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametricdown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharpsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, thecoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can bereplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowingfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experimentexploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in theefficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinearcrystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters.

We point out the serious, innate problems one zonesynchrotron-self Compton models have in simulating high energy variability. Wethen present the first steps toward a multi zone model where non-local, timedelayed Synchrotron-self Compton electron energy losses are taken into account.By introducing only one additional parameter, the length of the system, ourcode can simulate variability properly at Compton dominated stages, a situationtypical of flaring systems. As a first application, we were able to reproducevariability similar to that observed in the case of the puzzling `orphan' TeVflares that are not accompanied by a corresponding X-ray flare.",

Numerical solutions computed usingdifferent boundary treatments are compared to a `reference' numerical solutionobtained by placing the outer boundary at a very large radius. For eachboundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations andextracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,thereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. Thesetests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einsteinequations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system arereviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom ispresented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing theincoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and theconstraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Ratherdifferent approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatialcompactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found herecombines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze theNewman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control gauge reflections.",

Given that approximately 25% ofcataclysmic variables contain a magnetic white dwarf, and that our large sampleof close binary systems should contain many progenitors of cataclysmicvariables, it is quite surprising that we find only two potential magneticwhite dwarfs in this sample. The candidate magnetic white dwarfs, if confirmed,would possess relatively low magnetic field strengths (B_WD < 10 MG) that aresimilar to those of intermediate-Polars but are much less than the averagefield strength of the current Polar population. Additional observations ofthese systems are required to definitively cast the white dwarfs as magnetic.Even if these two systems prove to be the first evidence of detached magneticwhite dwarf + M dwarf binaries, there is still a large disparity between theproperties of the presently known cataclysmic variable population and thepresumed close binary progenitors.",

We show that, for linesthat can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the linecritical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-formingmolecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similarphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlationbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density linesprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a starformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that asimple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenouscan quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galacticluminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, andnaturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predictthat IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in whichthe median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction maybe tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediatecritical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming highredshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.hint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity inthe HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with theassumption of a constant star formation efficiency.",

For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probabilitydistribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of purestate density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simplegenerating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when aquantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of productsof system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member ofthe quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unittrace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descentrelations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, undercontraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, weconsider a quantum system evolving by It\\^o stochastic and by jump processSchr\\\"odinger equations.

We observe that very quickly the modeamplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations isreduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo acyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward afull equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitationalradiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very longtimescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered areshear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We varyproprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperatureT_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCAreactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain toranges of these parameters.

The bluestraggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB orRGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency atlarge distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate thatthe stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present densitystructure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusuallylow central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite ofthis, the specific frequency of blue stragglers that puts it right on thefrequency -- cluster M_V relation observed for other clusters.",

        "abstract": "Using numerical simulations, we investigate vortex configurations and pinningin superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that avariety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer andfractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arraysproduce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the criticaldepinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaksat noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located inthe large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycombpinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillingsB/B_\\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recentexperiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generallyoccur at B/B_\\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronouncedmatching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\\phi=n. At thenoninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, theinterstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-merstates that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states\"vortex molecular crystals\" and \"vortex plastic crystals\" since they aresimilar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.We argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common withcertain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models.

The Jovian-type planets inthe two binaries of Gamma Cephei and GJ 86 have brought to the forefrontquestions on the formation of giant planets and the possibility of theexistence of smaller bodies in such dynamically complex environments. Thediverse dynamical characteristics of these objects have made scientists wonderto what extent the current theories of planet formation can be applied tobinaries and multiple star systems. At present, the sensitivity of thedetection techniques does not allow routine discovery of Earth-sized bodies inbinary systems. However, with the advancement of new techniques, and with therecent launch of CoRoT and the launch of Kepler in late 2008, the detection ofmore planets (possibly terrestrial-class objects) in such systems is on thehorizon.

        "abstract": "The discovery of a flux excess in the far-ultraviolet (UV) spectrum ofelliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear thatthis UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning starswithout large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their originhas remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost theirenvelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarfpopulation in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary populationsynthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on thebinary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hotsubdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproducesmost of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range ofobserved UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolutionwith redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostictools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications forunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies ingeneral. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, ashad been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be stronglydependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally fromdwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.",

Oneof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-inducedvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristicvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Datafor the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 arepresented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in thiscompact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDVthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in thevariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored theflux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25mUrumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine thevariability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes ofthe variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropicannual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation isin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adoptinga simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequencydependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of thescattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size.

We derive useful parameters to quantify thedegree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic ofthe microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between modelsand observations.

The patterns appeared in thisprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprisesmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters.

As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronizationbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number ofsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration andseparation of the small clusters.

In searching for periodic modulation in this typeof data using power spectra it can be important to use appropriate weighting ofdata points to achieve the best sensitivity. It was recently demonstrated thatfor Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce thesensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness. Instead, amodified weighting scheme, based on the Cochran semi-weighted mean, givesimproved results independent of source brightness. We investigate the benefitsof weighting power spectra in period searches using simulated GLAST LATobservations of gamma-ray binaries.",

Allmeasurements were carried out using the heavy-ion Test Storage Ring at the MaxPlanck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. We have alsocarried out new multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations using theAUTOSTRUCTURE code. For electron-ion collision energies < 25 eV we find pooragreement between our experimental and theoretical resonance energies andstrengths. From 25 to 42 eV we find good agreement between the two forresonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonancestrengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger thanour estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26%(at a 90% confidence level). Above 42 eV the difference in the shape betweenthe calculated and measured 3s3p(^1P_1)nl DR series limit we attribute partlyto the nl dependence of the detection probabilities of high Rydberg states inthe experiment. We have used our measurements, supplemented by ourAUTOSTRUCTURE calculations, to produce a Maxwellian-averaged 3 -> 3 DR ratecoefficient for Fe XV forming Fe XIV. The resulting rate coefficient isestimated to be accurate to better than +/- 29% (at a 90% confidence level) fork_BT_e > 1 eV. At temperatures of k_BT_e ~ 2.5-15 eV, where Fe XV is predictedto form in photoionized plasmas, significant discrepancies are found betweenour experimentally-derived rate coefficient and previously publishedtheoretical results.

One type is not common locally and is apparently a looseassemblage of smaller galaxies.

One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated intothe arm tip by tidal forces.

In particular, allone-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the samedistribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correctionterms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging fromexcess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, anddepend on the arithmetic of the family.

Our formula highlights the differences that we expectto exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (forexample, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of ellipticcurves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower orderbiases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rankover Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions.

There is also a host of significant correlationsbetween the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in theoptical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, grouphierarchy).

We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitormass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\\rm cold} <0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems asa function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies andsatellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties ofthe last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halomass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter thatgoverns its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-typegalaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, anddoes not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact thatmore massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these threetrends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massiveearly-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxiesform in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \\times 10^{10} h^{-1}\\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low massearly-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last majormerger.

This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, wherethe dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-findingand HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations withradiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the sizedistributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even largerionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted meanhydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cmbrightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time includecorrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tailsof the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though theseeffects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include somepreliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range todate: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. Weshow that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires suchlarge scales. The speed and dynamic range provided by our semi-numericalapproach will be extremely useful in the modeling of early structure formationand reionization.",

We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear regionof M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,yielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images showno clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to theradio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separatefeatures located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The westernfeature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocitycorrespondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggestingthat this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongatednearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in thesame direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. Thisvelocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for theputative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed moleculargas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by thejet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-or Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.",

We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster andfind strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The bestfitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixedfaint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. Therate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistentwith that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internalmechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for thegeneral decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in differentenvironments.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor indetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning theprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) tomaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the linkcommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overallcommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a numberof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) andalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for bothmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graphdescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, weformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to acommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem towhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensivenumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergencespeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance ofa non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.",

The automatic optical and infraredtelescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. InJanuary-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in opticaland X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it iscomparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. InNovember 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescentstate, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to theJanuary-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overallwell correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days orhours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,but the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed onmonthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long termvariability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation aunique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions areinterpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within ajet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation dependson the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).",

So far, there has been little study on how this fundamentalresult will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks.

They have the potential to efficiently transport angularmomentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration ofoutflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implicationsfor disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weakionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be ableto effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisationequilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the diskmidplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic couplingby soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing theconductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains havegrown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fieldscan begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions aregenerally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions whileelectrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of themagnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers havea combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregatedto 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2.

In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be aclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenicneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, andfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at$\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as longas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. Onthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\sim10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalacticprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge whichscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrinobackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs andGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\sim10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic raysources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us informationon the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expectedsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection ofcosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.",

We explain the maximum in DAMA signalsobserved in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind theSun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as itmoves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well theiodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particlesfalling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentricorbits.

Our approach relieson the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models aninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizablelebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combinedwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlledway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appearwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings withseveral Higgs doublets.

The spin excitation inYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ is dominated by a sharp resonance peak at the frequency 40meV in the superconducting state. Below and above the resonance frequency, theincommensurate (IC) peaks develop and the intensity of the peaks decreasesdramatically. In the normal state, the resonant excitation does not occur andthe IC peaks are merged into commensurate ones. The spin excitation ofLa$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ is significantly different from that of Y-based ones,namely, the resonance peak does not exist due to the decreasing of thesuperconducting gap and the presence of the possible spin-stripe order. Thespectra are only enhanced at the expected resonance frequency (about 18 meV)while it is still incommensurate. On the other hand, another frequency scale atthe frequency 55 meV is also revealed, namely the spectra are commensurate andlocal maximum at this frequency.

In a setting generalizing the multi-armedbandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only theweights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, analgorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that ofthe best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, bya quantity that is proportional to 1/\\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially onthe number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linearcomplexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extensionto the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decisionmaker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosenpath at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where thedecision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of theproblem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed banditsetting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learnsonly the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individualedges on the path.

If the emitter movestowards us, whether a redshift, a blueshift or no shift is observed will dependon the speed vs. the distance. If the speed is in the range ofc(exp[-beta*D]-1) < v < 0, a redshift is observed; if the speed equalsc(exp[-beta*D]-1), no shift is observed; if the speed v less thanc(exp[-beta*D]-1), a blueshift is observed. A redshift will be always observedin all directions for any celestial objects as long as their distance from usis large enough.

In addition, wehave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrixelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can beconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. Theintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified throughthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associatedwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of theBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominatedby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with thedata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$decay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, directCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than thelatter. (iii) For $B\\to K\\pi\\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonantcontributions in $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\bar K^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ modes, in agreementwith the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result.",

The new definitions of the zero of time andthe time interval of a fitting region are proposed. These definitions forfitting the light curve lead us an unique definition of the decay index, whichis useful to investigate the structure of the GRB jet. We find that if the GRBjet has a core-envelope structure, the predicted distribution of the decayindex of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot beseen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decayindex distribution tells us the information on the jet structure.

We analyze the zero mode structure of D-braneinstantons on general type II orientifold compactifications, and show that onlyinstantons with O(1) symmetry can have just the two zero modes required tocontribute to the 4d superpotential.

In one-dimensional fieldtheories pseudoperiodic and quasiperiodic boundary conditions are also RG fixedpoints. Under these conditions massless bosonic free field theories areconformally invariant. Among all fixed points only Neumann boundary conditionsare infrared stable fixed points. All other conformal invariant boundaryconditions become unstable under some relevant perturbations. In finite volumeswe analyse the dependence of the vacuum energy along the trajectories of therenormalization group flow providing an interesting framework for dark energyevolution.

Weshow that the chemical potential can be absorbed into the quark masses; thetheory is in the same chiral symmetry class as QCD in three dimensions at zerochemical potential. In the limit of a large number of colors and fixed numberof lattice points, chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously, and our results arein agreement with expressions based on a chiral Lagrangian. In this limit, theeigenvalues of the Dirac operator are correlated according to random matrixtheory for QCD in three dimensions. The discontinuity of the chiral condensateis due to an alternative to the Banks-Casher formula recently discovered forQCD in four dimensions at nonzero chemical potential. The effect of temperatureon the average phase factor is discussed in a schematic random matrix model.",

        "abstract": "[Abridged] We have studied the optical spectra of 28 O- and early B-typestars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 22 of which are associated with the youngstar-forming region N11. Stellar parameters are determined using an automatedfitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND with thegenetic-algorithm optimisation routine PIKAIA. Results for stars in the LH9 andLH10 associations of N11 are consistent with a sequential star formationscenario, in which activity in LH9 triggered the formation of LH10. Our samplecontains four stars of spectral type O2, of which the hottest is found to be~49-54 kK (cf. ~45-46 kK for O3 stars). The masses of helium-enriched dwarfsand giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotatingevolutionary tracks. We interpret this as evidence for efficientrotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and toan increase of the stellar luminosity. This result is consistent with findingsfor SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no suchmass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly(or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to beintermediate to those found in massive stars in the Galaxy and the SMC, andcomparisons with theoretical predictions at LMC metallicity yielded goodagreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 < log L/L(sun) <6.1.",

        "abstract": "The two-dimensional kinetic Ising model, when exposed to an oscillatingapplied magnetic field, has been shown to exhibit a nonequilibrium,second-order dynamic phase transition (DPT), whose order parameter Q is theperiod-averaged magnetization. It has been established that this DPT falls inthe same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in thetwo-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the firsttime the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero,period-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by asquare-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent,\\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent forthe critical isotherm, \\delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This impliesthat H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-sizescaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical periodprovides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that,for a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, afluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperatureT_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature andfield amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b.

This area is markedby the presence of highly disturbed local HI and a preponderance ofintermediate- and high-velocity gas. The HI distribution toward the brightestpeaks in the WMAP Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map for this area isexamined and by comparing with a second area on the sky it is demonstrated thatthe associations do not appear to be the result of chance coincidence. Closeexamination of several of the associations reveals important new properties ofdiffuse interstellar neutral hydrogen structure. In the case of high-velocitycloud MI, the HI and WMAP ILC morphologies are similar and an excess of softX-ray emission and H-alpha emission have been reported for this feature. It issuggested that the small angular-scale, high frequency continuum emissionobserved by WMAP may be produced at the surfaces of HI features interacting oneanother, or at the interface between moving HI structures and regions ofenhanced plasma density in the surrounding interstellar medium. It is possiblethat dust grains play a role in producing the emission.

We employ an analytical 2-D model of the largescale coronal magnetic field that provides a good representation of the coronaat the minimum of solar activity. We use the mass-flux conservation equation todetermine the outflow speed of the solar wind at any location in the solarcorona and take into account the integration along the line of sight (LOS). Themain assumption we make is that no anisotropy in the kinetic temperature of thecoronal species is considered. We find that at distances greater than 1 Rsunfrom the solar surface the widths of the emitted lines of O VI and Mg X aresensitive to the details of the adopted electron density stratification.However, Ly-$\\alpha$, which is a pure radiative line, is hardly affected. Thecalculated total intensities of Ly-$\\alpha$ and the O VI doublet depend to alesser degree on the density stratification and are comparable to the observedones for most of the considered density models. The widths of the observedprofiles of Ly-$\\alpha$ and Mg X are well reproduced by most of the consideredelectron density stratifications, while for the O VI doublet only fewstratifications give satisfying results. The densities deduced from SOHO dataresult in O VI profiles whose widths and intensity ratio are relatively closeto the values observed by UVCS although only isotropic velocity distributionsare employed. These density profiles also reproduce the other consideredobservables with good accuracy. Thus the need for a strong anisotropy of thevelocity distribution (i.e. a temperature anisotropy) is not so clear cut asprevious investigations of UVCS data suggested. ...",

HS0805+3822 shows grazing eclipses and has a likely orbital period of 3.2169(2)h. Time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the new CVs (with the exception of HS0805+3822) is also presented. Radial velocity studies provided an orbitalperiod of 3.55 h for HS 1813+6122, which allowed us to identify the observedphotometric signal at 3.39 h as a negative superhump wave. The spectroscopicbehaviour clearly identifies these new CVs as new SW Sextantis stars. These newadditions increase the number of known SW Sex stars to 35. Almost 40 per centof the total SW Sex population do not show eclipses, invalidating therequirement of eclipses as a defining characteristic of the class and themodels based on a high orbital inclination geometry alone. On the other hand,the predominance of orbital periods in the narrow 3-4.5 h range is becomingmore pronounced. In fact, almost half the CVs which populate the 3-4.5 h periodinterval are definite members of the class. These statistics are confirmed byour results from the Hamburg Quasar Survey CVs. Remarkably, 54 per cent of theHamburg nova-like variables have been identified as SW Sex stars with orbitalperiods in the 3-4.5 h range. The observation of this pile-up of systems closeto the upper boundary of the period gap is difficult to reconcile with thestandard theory of CV evolution, as the SW Sex stars are believed to have thehighest mass transfer rates among CVs.

We consider mixtures with rods of different aspect ratios and spheresof different diameters, and we treat them within Onsager theory. Our resultsindicate that depletion effects, and consequently smectic stability, decreasesignificantly as a result of orientational disorder in the smectic phase whencompared with corresponding data based on the frozen--orientationapproximation. These results are discussed in terms of the $\\tau$ parameter,which has been proposed as a convenient measure of depletion strength. Wepresent closed expressions for $\\tau$, and show that it is intimately connectedwith the depletion potential.

        "abstract": "I discuss fundamental limits placed on information and information processingby gravity. Such limits arise because both information and its processingrequire energy, while gravitational collapse (formation of a horizon or blackhole) restricts the amount of energy allowed in a finite region. Specifically,I use a criterion for gravitational collapse called the hoop conjecture. Oncethe hoop conjecture is assumed a number of results can be obtained directly:the existence of a fundamental uncertainty in spatial distance of order thePlanck length, bounds on information (entropy) in a finite region, and a boundon the rate of information processing in a finite region. In the final sectionI discuss some cosmological issues related to the total amount of informationin the universe, and note that almost all detailed aspects of the late universeare determined by the randomness of quantum outcomes. This paper is based on atalk presented at a 2007 Bellairs Research Institute (McGill University)workshop on black holes and quantum information.",

        "abstract": "The local, uncorrelated multiplicative noises driving a second-order, purelynoise-induced, ordering phase transition (NIPT) were assumed to be Gaussian andwhite in the model of [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{73}, 3395 (1994)]. Thepotential scientific and technological interest of this phenomenon calls for astudy of the effects of the noises' statistics and spectrum. This task isfacilitated if these noises are dynamically generated by means of stochasticdifferential equations (SDE) driven by white noises. One such case is that ofOrnstein--Uhlenbeck noises which are stationary, with Gaussian pdf and avariance reduced by the self-correlation time (\\tau), and whose effect on theNIPT phase diagram has been studied some time ago. Another such case is whenthe stationary pdf is a (colored) Tsallis' (q)--\\emph{Gaussian} which, being a\\emph{fat-tail} distribution for (q>1) and a \\emph{compact-support} one for(q<1), allows for a controlled exploration of the effects of the departure fromGaussian statistics. As done before with stochastic resonance and otherphenomena, we now exploit this tool to study--within a simple mean-fieldapproximation and with an emphasis on the \\emph{order parameter} and the``\\emph{susceptibility}''--the combined effect on NIPT of the noises'statistics and spectrum. Even for relatively small (\\tau), it is shown thatwhereas fat-tail noise distributions ((q>1)) counteract the effect ofself-correlation, compact-support ones ((q<1)) enhance it. Also, an interestingeffect on the susceptibility is seen in the last case.",

The methods used to analyze open cluster remnants andcriteria to define them as physical systems are not homogeneous. In this workwe present a systematic method for studying these objects that provides a viewof their properties and allows their characterization. Eighteen remnantcandidates are analyzed by means of photometric and proper motion data. Thesedata provide information on objects and their fields. We establish criteria forcharacterizing open cluster remnants, taking observational uncertainties intoaccount. 2MASS J and H photometry is employed (i) to study structuralproperties of the objects by means of radial stellar density profiles, (ii) totest for any similarity between objects and fields with a statisticalcomparison method applied to the distributions of stars in the CMDs, and (iii)to obtain ages, reddening values, and distances from the CMD, taking an indexof isochrone fit into account. The UCAC2 proper motions allowed an objectivecomparison between objects and large solid angle offset fields. The objectiveanalysis based on the present methods indicates 13 open-cluster remnants in thesample. Evidence of the presence of binary stars is found, as expected fordynamically evolved systems. Finally, we infer possible evolutionary stagesamong remnants from the structure, proper motion, and CMD distributions. Thelow stellar statistics for individual objects is overcome by means of theconstruction of composite proper motion and CMD diagrams.

From a spectroscopically confirmed sample of 340globular clusters and 780 planetary nebulae, the rotation amplitude, rotationaxis, velocity dispersion, and the total dynamical mass are determined for thehalo of NGC 5128. The globular cluster kinematics were searched for both radialdependence and metallicity dependence by subdividing the globular clustersample into 158 metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) and 178 metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -1.0)globular clusters.

The kinematics are compared to theplanetary nebula population where differences are apparent in the outer regionsof the halo.

The relative age and metallicitysensitivities of AB system colours that relate to u, B, g, V, r, R, i, I, z, J,H, and K bands are presented, and the abilities of various colour pairs forbreaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertaintyparameter (UP) method. Our results suggest that a few pairs of colours can beused to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. This will bevery useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. Indetail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the bestpairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain twostellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89Gyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertaintiesin colours. Some other colour pairs, such as [(R-K), (u-R)], [(I-K), (u-R)],[(R-K), (u-r)] and [(i-J), (u-R)], can possibly be used for constraining thetwo parameters, too.

Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove (2001), byexploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using anew hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscousevolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, andSaturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end uplocked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, theresonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets inthe disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance forthe two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration.If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped orreversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height,this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks.

This is similar to the caseof the B-emission X-ray binaries, where a sizable fraction of the neutron starsreceived hardly any velocity kick at birth (Pfahl et al. 2002). The masses ofthe second-born neutron stars in five of the six low-eccentricity doubleneutron stars are remarkably low (between 1.18 and 1.30 Msun). It is arguedthat these low-mass, low-kick neutron stars were formed by the electron-capturecollapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg cores of helium stars less massive thanabout 3.5 Msun, whereas the higher-mass, higher kick-velocity neutron starswere formed by the collapses of the iron cores of higher initial mass.

Weassume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, istransferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoreticalmodel of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description ofstar-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies andtheir central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider twodistinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disksand radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer toas RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretiondisks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. Wefind that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretionrate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to aRIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient andslightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completelyhalts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes astochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrentshort-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predictsseveral properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometricluminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGNlifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxiesand their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the centralblack hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of thestrength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback. (abridged)",

About 64% ofthe sources show line wings in one or more transitions of CO, HCO^+ and CSspecies, indicating the presence of molecular outflows. Comparison of thewidths of line wings and methanol maser emission suggests that the 6.7GHz maserline traces the environment of MYSO of various kinematic regimes. Thereforeconditions conducive for the methanol maser can exist in the inner parts ofmolecular clouds or circumstellar discs as well as in the outer partsassociated with molecular outflows. Calculations of the physical conditionsbased on the CO and HCO^+ lines and the CS line intensity ratios refine theinput parameters for maser models.",

Only 7 out of 29 resolved mm cores (and 16 out of the 26unresolved ones) do not exhibit signposts of star formation activity.

The distribution of the spectralindices pertaining to the associated sources is peaked at values typical ofClass I objects, while three objects are signalled as candidates Class 0sources. We remark the high detection rate (30%) of H_2 jets driven by sourceslocated inside the mm-cores. They appear not driven by the most luminousobjects in the field, but rather by less luminous objects in young clusters,testifying the co-existence of both low- and intermediate-mass star formation.The presented results reliably describe the young population of VMR-D. However,the statistical evaluation of activity vs inactivity of the investigated cores,even in good agreement with results found for other star forming regions, seemsto reflect the limiting sensitivity of the available facilities rather than anyproperty intrinsic to the mm-condensations.",

The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emissionthrough the 3 and 4.6 micron region and in absorption in the 2 micron region.The 4.6 micron spectrum shows a rich 'forest' of emission lines. All thespectral lines observed in the 2.3-4.6 micron spectrum are shown to becircumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm theoxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to thepreviously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption lineprofiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layernear the dust disk.

The UBVRIJHK light curves and the color indices of SN 2003du closely resemblethose of normal SNe Ia. SN 2003du reached a B-band maximum of 13.49 (+/-0.02)mag on JD2452766.38 (+/-0.5).

The reddening in the host galaxy was estimated by threemethods, and was consistently found to be negligible. We estimate a distancemodulus of 32.79 (+/-0.15) mag to the host galaxy, UGC 9391. The peak UVOIRbolometric luminosity of 1.35(+/-0.20) 10^43 erg/s and Arnett's rule impliesthat M(Ni56)=0.68 (+/-0.14)M_sun of Ni56 was synthesized during the explosion.Modeling of the UVOIR bolometric light curve also indicates M(Ni56) in therange 0.6-0.8 M_sun.

The angular statistics of thedumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,increasing elasticity and inertia.

While the renormalizable Standard Model forbids proton decay mediatingoperators due to accidental global symmetries, many extensions of the StandardModel introduce such dimension four, five and six operators. Furthermore,quantum gravity effects are expected to induce proton instability, indicatingthat the higher energy cutoff scale must be above 10^{16}GeV. Quasi-realisticheterotic string models provide the arena to explore how perturbative quantumgravity affects the particle physics phenomenology. An appealing explanationfor the proton longevity is provided by the existence of an Abelian gaugesymmetry that suppresses the proton decay mediating operators. Additionally,such a low-scale U(1) symmetry should: allow the suppression of the left-handedneutrino masses by a seesaw mechanism; allow fermion Yukawa couplings to theelectroweak Higgs doublets; be anomaly free; be family universal. Theserequirements render the existence of such U(1) symmetries in quasi-realisticheterotic string models highly non-trivial. We demonstrate the existence of aU(1) symmetry that satisfies all of the above requirements in a class ofleft-right symmetric heterotic string models in the free fermionic formulation.The existence of the extra Z' in the energy range accessible to futureexperiments is motivated by the requirement of adequate suppression of protondecay mediation.

We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phasetransitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of thephase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyondthis transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, thespace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states andconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealedone. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominantstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes isallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, abovethe coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all thecritical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determinetheir asymptotic values for large number of colors.

We study the resulting differentiallyrotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. Thepredominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. Theradial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths ofinterest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accretedangular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives littleviscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will berequired to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our modelsillustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when thebuoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashesis overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, ormay depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimesof burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavierelements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain theshort recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed toexplain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a secondregime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,quenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burstproperties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be importantfor triggering and fueling superbursts.

These observations show the presence of a threemillion solar mass black hole in Sagittarius A* beyond any reasonable doubt.The Galactic Center thus constitutes the best astrophysical evidence for theexistence of black holes which have long been postulated, and is also an ideal`lab' for studying the physics in the vicinity of such an object. Remarkably,young massive stars are present there and probably have formed in the innermoststellar cusp. Variable infrared and X-ray emission from Sagittarius A* are anew probe of the physical processes and space-time curvature just outside theevent horizon.",

However, the 2-local modelHamiltonians used in these proofs are general and hence do not limit the typesof interactions required between spins. To address this concern, the presentpaper provides two simple model Hamiltonians that are of practical interest toexperimentalists working towards the realization of a universal adiabaticquantum computer. The model Hamiltonians presented are the simplest knownQMA-complete 2-local Hamiltonians. The 2-local Ising model with 1-localtransverse field which has been realized using an array of technologies, isperhaps the simplest quantum spin model but is unlikely to be universal foradiabatic quantum computation. We demonstrate that this model can be rendereduniversal and QMA-complete by adding a tunable 2-local transverse XX coupling.We also show the universality and QMA-completeness of spin models with only1-local Z and X fields and 2-local ZX interactions.",

Seven distinct re-brightening events starting from 236 s up to 41.2 ksafter the burst were observed.

Previoussubmm imaging resolved this region into a cluster of 5 dust cores, one of whichis associated with the UCHII region G23.96+0.15, and another with an H2O maser.In our new 2.7 mm continuum image, only the UCHII region is detected, withtotal flux and morphology in good agreement with the free-free emission in VLAcm-wave maps. For the other four objects, the nondetections at 2.7 mm and inthe MSX mid-IR bands are consistent with cool dust emission with a temperatureof 13-40K and luminosity of 1000-40000 Lsun. By combining single-dish andinterferometric data, we have identified over two dozen virialized C18O coresin this region that contain ~40% of the total molecular gas mass present. Whilethe overall extent of the C18O and dust emission is similar, the emission peaksdo not correlate well in detail. At least 11 of the 123 stars identified by2MASS in this region are likely to be within the star-forming cluster. Twostars (both associated with the UCHII region) were previously identified as Ostars via IR spectroscopy. Most of the rest of the reddened stars have noobvious correlation with the C18O cores or the dust cores. In summary, ourobservations indicate that considerable fragmentation of the molecular cloudhas taken place during the time required for the UCHII region to form and the Ostars to become detectable at IR wavelengths.

The eclipse shape is highly variable, even changing form cycle to cycle. Thisis most likely due to accretion disc surface brightness distributionvariations, most probably caused by strong flickering.

In this paper,we study statistical correlations between two features which are likely to becentral to any potential description of nature at high energy scales: gaugesymmetries and spacetime supersymmetry. We analyze correlations between thesetwo kinds of symmetry within the context of perturbative heterotic stringvacua, and find a number of striking features. We find, for example, that thedegree of spacetime supersymmetry is strongly correlated with the probabilitiesof realizing certain gauge groups, with unbroken supersymmetry at the stringscale tending to favor gauge-group factors with larger rank.

Assuming that dark matter is composed primarily of weaklyinteracting massive particles (WIMPs), a star orbiting close enough to the SMBHcan capture WIMPs at an extremely high rate. The stellar luminosity due toannihilation of captured WIMPs in the stellar core may be comparable to or evenexceed the luminosity of the star due to thermonuclear burning. The model thuspredicts the existence of unusual stars, i.e. \"WIMP burners\", in the vicinityof an adiabatically grown SMBH. We find that the most efficient WIMP burnersare stars with degenerate electron cores, e.g. white dwarfs (WD) or degeneratecores with envelopes. If found, such stars would provide evidence for theexistence of particle dark matter and could possibly be used to establish itsdensity profile. In our previous paper we computed the luminosity from WIMPburning for a range of dark matter spike density profiles, degenerate coremasses, and distances from the SMBH. Here we compare our results with theobserved stars closest to the Galactic center and find that they could beconsistent with WIMP burners in the form of degenerate cores with envelopes. Wealso cross-check the WIMP burner hypothesis with the EGRET observed flux ofgamma-rays from the Galactic center, which imposes a constraint on the darkmatter spike density profile and annihilation cross-section. We find that theEGRET data is consistent with the WIMP burner hypothesis. New high precisionmeasurements by GLAST will confirm or set stringent limits on a dark matterspike at the Galactic center, which will in turn support or set stringentlimits on the existence of WIMP burners at the Galactic center.",

For the$H\\to ZZ$ mode, the resummation effects increase the acceptance of the signalevents by about 25%, as compared to the NLO prediction, and dramatically altervarious kinematics distributions of the final state leptons. For the $H\\to WW$mode, the acceptance rates of the signal events predicted by the resummationand NLO calculations are almost the same, but some of the predicted kinematicaldistributions are quite different.

While our sample isdefinitively not representative of the total open cluster sample in the Galaxy,it does cover a wide range of cluster parameters and is uniform enough to allowfor simple statistical considerations. BV wide-field CCD photometry wasobtained for open clusters for which photometric, structural, and dynamicalevolution parameters were determined. The limiting and core radii weredetermined by analyzing radial density profiles. The ages, reddenings, anddistances were obtained from the solar metallicity isochrone fitting. The massfunction was used to study the dynamical state of the systems, mass segregationeffect and to estimate the total mass and number of cluster members. This studyreports on the first determination of basic parameters for 11 out of 42observed open clusters. The angular sizes for the majority of the observedclusters appear to be several times larger than the catalogue data indicate.The core and limiting cluster radii are correlated and the latter parameter is3.2 times larger on average. The limiting radius increases with the cluster'smass, and both the limiting and core radii decrease in the course of dynamicalevolution. For dynamically not advanced clusters, the mass function slope issimilar to the universal IMF slope. For more evolved systems, the effect ofevaporation of low-mass members is clearly visible. The initial masssegregation is present in all the observed young clusters, whereas thedynamical mass segregation appears in clusters older than about log(age)=8.Low-mass stars are deficient in the cores of clusters older than log(age)=8.5and not younger than one relaxation time.",

With the knowledge of thehost star's physical parameters, the planetary radius can be determined.Combined with spectroscopic observations the mass and therefore the density canbe derived from Doppler-measurements. Depending on the brightness of the hoststar, additional information, e. g. about the spin-orbit alignment between thehost star and planetary orbit, can be obtained.  Aims: The last few years have witnessed a growing success of transit surveys.Among other surveys, the MACHO project provided nine potential transitingplanets, several of them with relatively bright parent stars. The photometricsignature of a transit event is, however, insufficient to confirm the planetarynature of the faint companion. The aim of this paper therefore is adetermination of the spectroscopic parameters of the host stars as well as adynamical mass determination through Doppler-measurements.  Methods: We have obtained follow-up high-resolution spectra for five starsselected from the MACHO sample, which are consistent with transits oflow-luminosity objects. Radial velocities have been determined by means ofcross-correlation with model spectra. The MACHO light curves have been comparedto simulations based on the physical parameters of the system derived from theradial velocities and spectral analyses.

This interesting result arises from an analysis employingthe Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubitstates. Recently, Mintert {\\em et al.} proposed generalizations of Woottersconcurrence for multipartite states. These MKB concurrences possess amathematical property that enables one to understand the origin of thischaracteristic behavior. Here, we first study the effect of anisotropy andmagnetic field on the multipartite thermal entanglement of a four-qubitHeisenberg XY chain using the MKB concurrences. We show that this modelexhibits characteristic behavior similar to that of the two-qubit model. Inaddition, we show that this can again be understood using the same mathematicalproperty. Next, we show that the six-qubit Heisenberg XY chain possessesproperties necessary for it to have the characteristic behavior too. Mostimportantly, it is possible to directly measure the multipartite MKBconcurrences of pure states. This may provide an experimental verification ofour conjecture that for a Heisenberg XY chain of any even number of qubits, itis always possible to obtain non-zero genuine multipartite entanglement at anyfinite temperature by applying a sufficiently large magnetic field.",

Our data were taken mostly with the near infraredadaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profilestypically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there isunambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In thenuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a fewpercent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales theluminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows asimilar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface densityexceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limitedand hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur inmultiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onsetof star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whetherthis may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play infuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds andsupernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.",

In order to study this point, wehave prepared good quality samples of polycrystalline $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_{4}$using the wet-chemical method, which has demonstrated to produce samples with abetter cation distribution. In particular, we have studied the temperaturedependence of the second critical field, $H_{c2}(T)$, through the magnetizationmeasurements on two samples with opposite average carrier concentration($\\rho_m=x$) and nearly the same critical temperature, namely $\\rho_m = 0.08$(underdoped) and $\\rho_m = 0.25$ (overdoped).

In the context of dwarf spheroidalgalaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine BSS population from youngmain sequence (MS) stars tracing a ~1-2 Gyr old star forming episode. Assumingthat their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSSfrequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using acompilation of ground and space based photometry.  Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarfgalaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters ofsimilar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarfgalaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo;and most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significantanti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv.  The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxysample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) anegligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that theirblue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. The dwarf galaxiesanti-correlation can be used as a discriminator: galaxies obeying theanti-correlation are more likely to possess genuine primordial BSS rather thanyoung main sequence stars.",

For J/J' > 1, this model is believed to describe the magneticproperties of the mineral volborthite. In the classical limit, it exhibits twokinds of ground states: a ferrimagnetic state for J/J' < 1/2 and a largemanifold of canted spin states for J/J' > 1/2. To include quantum effectsself-consistently, we investigate the Sp(N) symmetric generalisation of theoriginal SU(2) symmetric model in the large-N limit. In addition to thedependence on the anisotropy, the Sp(N) symmetric model depends on a parameterkappa that measures the importance of quantum effects. Our numericalcalculations reveal that in the kappa-J/J' plane, the system shows a rich phasediagram containing a ferrimagnetic phase, an incommensurate phase, and adecoupled chain phase, the latter two with short- and long-range order. Wecorroborate these results by showing that the boundaries between the variousphases and several other features of the Sp(N) phase diagram can be determinedby analytical calculations. Finally, the application of a block-spinperturbation expansion to the trimerised version of the original spin-1/2 modelleads us to suggest that in the limit of strong anisotropy, J/J' >> 1, theground state of the original model is a collinearly ordered antiferromagnet,which is separated from the incommensurate state by a quantum phase transition.",

        "abstract": "In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is theintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomlyoriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.However, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class oftheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generatesa significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of actionequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to coupleto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPBgyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by theEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does notapply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of theHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. calledEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions ofthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen forthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible withthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has eitherghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problemscan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in additionchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. Thisyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reactionprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes doesnot couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafujitheory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. Theremay be other torsion theories which do.",

In contrast, stars with masses M > 3 M_sun seem to beconcentrated closer to the ZAMS. The study of a few known members of nearbyopen clusters with accurate Hipparcos parallaxes confirms these conclusions.Stronger magnetic fields tend to be found in hotter, younger and more massivestars, as well as in stars with shorter rotation periods. No evidence is foundfor any loss of angular momentum during the main-sequence life. The magneticflux remains constant over the stellar life time on the main sequence.

The obliquity angle distribution as inferred from thedistribution of r-values appears random at the time magnetic stars becomeobservable on the H-R diagram.

While we find a strong hint foran increase of beta with the elapsed time on the main sequence for stars with M> 3 M_sun, no similar trend is found for stars with M < 3 M_sun.

The well-known ``spiral arms'' are clearly observed and theytrail the rotating disk material. Weaker arms never before reported are alsoseen. The inter-arm space becomes brighter, but the structures become moreneutral in color at longer wavelengths, which is not consistent with modelsthat assume that they are due to the effects of a warped disk. Along the majordisk axis, the colors of the scattered-light relative to the star are \\Delta(F435W-F606W) ~ 0.0--0.2 mags and \\Delta (F435W-F814W)~0.5--1 mags.

The disk colors are similar to those derivedfor Kuiper Belt objects, suggesting that the same processes responsible fortheir colors may be at work here. We argue that we are observing only thegeometrically thick, optically thin envelope of the disk, while the opticallythick disk responsible for the far-IR emission is undetected. The observedspiral arms are then structures on this envelope. The colors indicate that theextended nebulosity is not a remnant of the infalling envelope but reprocesseddisk material.",

Differential motions in the fluid disccause converging flows which lead to strong spiral shocks once each superhumpcycle. The dissipation associated with these shocks powers the superhump. Wecompare 2D and 3D results, and conclude that 3D simulations are necessary tofaithfully simulate the disc dynamics. We ran our simulations for unprecedenteddurations, so that an eccentric equilibrium is established except at high massratios where the growth rate of the instability is very low. Our improvedsimulations give a closer match to the observed relationship between superhumpperiod excess and binary mass ratio than previous numerical work. The observedblack hole X-ray transient superhumpers appear to have systematically lowerdisc precession rates than the cataclysmic variables. This could be due tohigher disc temperatures and thicknesses. The modulation in total viscousdissipation on the superhump period is overwhelmingly from the region of thedisc within the 3:1 resonance radius. As the eccentric instability develops,the viscous torques are enhanced, and the disc consequently adjusts to a newequilibrium state, as suggested in the thermal-tidal instability model. Wequantify this enhancement in the viscosity, which is ~10 per cent for q=0.08.We characterise the eccentricity distributions in our accretion discs, and showthat the entire body of the disc partakes in the eccentricity.",

Spitzer Space Telescope observations ofthermal emission at 24 and 70 microns are combined with visible photometry toconstrain the system's effective radius (109 +10/-11 km) and geometric albedo(0.084 +0.021/-0.014). We estimate the average bulk density to be 1.37+0.66/-0.32 g cm^-3, consistent with ice plus rocky and/or carbonaceousmaterials. This density contrasts with lower densities recently measured withthe same technique for three other comparably-sized outer Solar System binaries(617) Patroclus, (26308) 1998 SM165, and (47171) 1999 TC36, and is closer tothe density of the saturnian irregular satellite Phoebe.

In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-densitywaves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, criticaltransition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosedeven above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides theresistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster thanin the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourablenesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted bythe same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence ofalternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain themost fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latestdevelopments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy(ARPES) here we show that the normal-state pseudogap also exists in one of themost studied 2D examples, dichalcogenide 2H-TaSe2, and the formation of CDW isdriven by a conventional nesting instability, which is masked by the pseudogap.Our findings reconcile and explain a number of unusual, as previously believed,experimental responses as well as disprove many alternative theoreticalapproaches.

We find that the continuum dust thermal emission atlambda(rest)=6.7um is correlated with the optical luminosity, following thenon-linear relation L(6.7um) propto L(5100A)^0.82. We also find an anticorrelation between the ratio L(6.7um)/L(5100A) and the [OIII]5007A lineluminosity. These effects are interpreted as a decreasing covering factor ofthe circumnuclear dust as a function of luminosity. Such a result is inagreement with the decreasing fraction of absorbed AGNs as a function ofluminosity recently found in various surveys. We clearly detect the silicateemission feature in the average spectrum, but also in four individual objects.These are the Silicate emission in the most luminous objects obtained so far.When combined with the silicate emission observed in local, low luminositytype-I AGNs, we find that the silicate emission strength is correlated withluminosity.  The silicate strength of all type-I AGNs also follows a positive correlationwith the black hole mass and with the accretion rate. The Polycyclic AromaticHydrocarbon (PAH) emission features, expected from starburst activity, are notdetected in the average spectrum of luminous, high-z QSOs.

Possible reasons for this are presented anddiscussed; however, the overwhelming conclusion seems to be that a morecomplete and thorough cluster search is needed covering at least 4 squaredegrees centered on M33.",

        "abstract": "We have selected a sample of 88 nearby (z<0.1) galaxy clusters from theSDSS-DR4 with redshift information for the cluster members. We have derivedglobal properties for each cluster, such as their mean recessional velocity,velocity dispersion, and virial radii. Cluster galaxies have been grouped intwo families according to their $u-r$ colours. The total sample consists of10865 galaxies. As expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned tobe early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the clustercentre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones. Thebrightest cluster galaxies are located in the innermost regions and show thesmallest velocity dispersions. Early-type galaxies also show constant velocitydispersion profiles inside the virial radius and a mild decline in theoutermost regions. In contrast, late-type galaxies show always decreasingvelocity dispersions profiles. No correlation has been found between thefraction of blue galaxies and cluster global properties, such as clustervelocity dispersion and galaxy concentration. In contrast, we found correlationbetween the X-ray luminosity and the fraction of blue galaxies. These resultsindicate that early- and late-type galaxies may have had different evolution.Thus, blue galaxies are located in more anisotropic and radial orbits thanearly-type ones. Their star formation seems to be independent of the clusterglobal properties in low mass clusters, but not for the most massive ones.These observational results suggest that the global environment could beimportant for driving the evolution of galaxies in the most massive cluster($\\sigma > 800$ km s$^{-1}$). However, the local environment could play a keyrole in galaxy evolution for low mass clusters.",

We showthat it is impossible to estimate the unconditional distribution withreasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that noestimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally).This follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performanceof estimators for the distribution; performance is here measured by theprobability that the estimation error exceeds a given threshold.

We estimate the stellar massfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy starformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to acontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)stellar masses. At low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population oflow-mass galaxies (<10^9 Msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (M_I-M_K=0.3).In general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and moresignificantly above this redshift. Conversely, a massive tail is present up toz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (M_I-M_K=0.7-0.8). We find a decline withredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% forM>10^8 Msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution(`mass-downsizing'). In particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible(<30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (>6x10^10 Msun). For lessmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. A large fraction (>=50%)of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gasinto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of theirassembly history below z=1.

However, very few X-ray polarizationmeasurements have been made, and then only mono-energetic detections, whilstseveral objects are assumed to have energy dependent polarization signatures.In this paper we investigate whether detection of energy dependent polarizationfrom cosmic sources is possible using the Compton technique, in particular withthe proposed PoGOLite balloon-experiment, in the 25-100 keV range. We useGeant4 simulations of a PoGOLite model and input photon spectra based on CygnusX-1 and accreting magnetic pulsars (100 mCrab). Effective observing times of 6and 35 hours were simulated, corresponding to a standard and a long durationflight respectively. Both smooth and sharp energy variations of thepolarization are investigated and compared to constant polarization signalsusing chi-square statistics. We can reject constant polarization, with energy,for the Cygnus X-1 spectrum (in the hard state), if the reflected component isassumed to be completely polarized, whereas the distinction cannot be made forweaker polarization. For the accreting pulsar, constant polarization can berejected in the case of polarization in a narrow energy band with at least 50%polarization, and similarly for a negative step distribution from 30% to 0%polarization.",

The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/opticalemission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical andX-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the mainpeak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the promptemission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. Theoptical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, ratherthan single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SEDshows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviourmight be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densitiessimilar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. Theafterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both areconsistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 isthe instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using acombination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of2.8x10^53 erg over 1keV - 10MeV in the GRB rest frame.

In particular,the contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usuallyan increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hardX-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS),the X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate alsoin the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]  Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scatteringcontribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed interms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-establishedtheory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on thebasis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analyticaltranslation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - viceversa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. ThisPSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet theH(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.  We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism tocompute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that thePSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverseproblem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirrorsurface PSD from a measured function H(E).

In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governingthe deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variableYoung's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, exceptfor a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are thetransverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to includebottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stressfunctions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We furthershow that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thicknessvaries, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that thedegree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidaltangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shelland are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexureequations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for theprediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for theconstruction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.",

We find that the luminosityof the pulsar increased by a factor of 100 in the interval betweenobservations, from 1e33 to 1e35 erg/s (0.5-8.0 keV), and that its spectrumhardened. The pulsed count rate increased by a factor of 10 (0.5-8.0 keV), butthe fractional rms amplitude of the pulses decreased from 65 to 11 per cent,and their profile changed from being single-peaked to exhibiting three peaks.Similar changes have been observed from other magnetars in response tooutbursts, such as that of 1E 2259+586 in 2002 June.

As young AGN(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxiesbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases andthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presentedhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous toradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely thatthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply beenpushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a largeintrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =0.06 is also seen. It is associated in the DIR model with an increase inluminosity as the sources mature but, if real, is difficult to interpret in thecosmological redshift (CR) model since at this low redshift it is unlikely tobe associated with a higher star formation rate or an increase in the materialused to build galaxies.

We measured the radial velocity curve from the wings of thedouble-peaked H$\\alpha$ emission line, and obtained a semi-amplitude value thatis in excellent agreement with the obtained from observations in theultraviolet spectral region by Sion et al. (1998). We present also a new methodto obtain K_2, which enhances the detection of absorption or emission featuresarising in the late-type companion. Our results are compared with publishedvalues derived from the near-infrared NaI line doublet. From a comparison ofthe TiO band with those of late type M stars, we find that a best fit isobtained for a M6V star, contributing 5 percent of the total light at thatspectral region. Assuming that the radial velocity semi-amplitudes reflectaccurately the motion of the binary components, then from our results: K_em =107+/-2 km/s; K_abs = 310+/-5 km/s, and using the inclination angle given byZhang & Robinson(1987); i = 69.7+/-0.7, the system parameters become: M_WD =1.20+/-0.05 M_sun,; M_RD = 0.42+/-0.04 M_sun; and a = 1.55+/- 0.02 R_sun.

The current sample of Chandraobservations was fit using the constrains of the charge exchange model, andrelative solar wind abundances were derived from the X-ray spectra. Ouranalysis showed that spectral differences can be ascribed to different solarwind states, as such identifying comets interacting with (I) fast, cold wind,(II), slow, warm wind and (III) disturbed, fast, hot winds associated withinterplanetary coronal mass ejections.

Previous models ofSolar System formation considered a supernova shock that triggered the collapseof the Sun's nascent molecular cloud. We advocate an alternative hypothesis,that the Solar System's protoplanetary disk had already formed when a veryclose (< 1 pc) supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk.We conduct the first numerical simulations designed to answer two questionsrelated to this hypothesis: will the disk be destroyed by such a closesupernova; and will any of the ejecta be mixed into the disk? Our simulationsdemonstrate that the disk does not absorb enough momentum from the shock toescape the protostar to which it is bound. Only low amounts (< 1%) of mass lossoccur, due to stripping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities across the top of thedisk, which also mix into the disk about 1% of the intercepted ejecta. Theselow efficiencies of destruction and injectation are due to the fact that thehigh disk pressures prevent the ejecta from penetrating far into the diskbefore stalling. Injection of gas-phase ejecta is too inefficient to beconsistent with the abundances of radionuclides inferred from meteorites. Onthe other hand, the radionuclides found in meteorites would have condensed intodust grains in the supernova ejecta, and we argue that such grains will beinjected directly into the disk with nearly 100% efficiency. The meteoriticabundances of the short-lived radionuclides such as 60Fe therefore areconsistent with injection of grains condensed from the ejecta of a nearby (< 1pc) supernova, into an already-formed protoplanetary disk.",

The published distant and local Ia SNeused for the Supernova Legacy Survey first-year cosmology report form thesample for this study. While previous work has assumed that the local SNe areat rest in the CMB frame (the No Flow assumption), we test this assumption byapplying peculiar velocity corrections to the local SNe using three differentflow models. The models are based on the IRAS PSCz galaxy redshift survey, havevarying beta = Omega_m^0.6/b, and reproduce the Local Group motion in the CMBframe. These datasets are then fit for w, Omega_m, and Omega_Lambda usingflatness or LambdaCDM and a BAO prior. The chi^2 statistic is used to examinethe effect of the velocity corrections on the quality of the fits. The mostfavored model is the beta=0.5 model, which produces a fit significantly betterthan the No Flow assumption, consistent with previous peculiar velocitystudies. By comparing the No Flow assumption with the favored models we derivethe largest potential systematic error in w caused by ignoring peculiarvelocities to be Delta w = +0.04. For Omega_Lambda, the potential error isDelta Omega_Lambda = -0.04 and for Omega_m, the potential error is DeltaOmega_m < +0.01.

As a consequence, with the lowering of temperature, there canoccur a transition from a Wigner crystal charge-ordered state to a spin-Peierlsstate that is a Bond-Charge-Density Wave with charge occupancies different fromthe Wigner crystal. This transition is possible because spin excitations fromthe spin-Peierls state in the 1/4-filled band are necessarily accompanied bychanges in site charge densities.

In this paper we present the measurement of the Optical LuminosityFunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results withprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. Ourdata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow usto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. Bycombining our faint VVDS sample with the large sample of bright AGN extractedfrom the SDSS DR3 (Richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of differentevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents thecombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, isa luminosity dependent density evolution (LDDE) model, similar to those derivedfrom the major X-surveys. Such a parameterization allows the redshift of theAGN space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains theexcess of faint AGN that we find at 1.0< z <1.5. On the basis of this model wefind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, thatthe peak of the AGN space density shifts significantly towards lower redshiftgoing to lower luminosity objects. This result, already found in a number ofX-ray selected samples of AGN, is consistent with a scenario of \"AGN cosmicdownsizing\", in which the density of more luminous AGN, possibly associated tomore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the Universe, thanthat of low luminosity ones.",

Considering the strong dependence of planet frequency on stellarmetallicity, we studied the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791 and searchedfor close-in planets using the transit technique.  Methods. A ten-night observational campaign was performed using theCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope (3.6m), the San Pedro M\\'artir telescope (2.1m),and the Loiano telescope (1.5m). To increase the transit detection probabilitywe also made use of the Bruntt et al. (2003) eight-nights observationalcampaign. Adequate photometric precision for the detection of planetarytransits was achieved.  Results. Should the frequency and properties of close-in planets in NGC 6791be similar to those orbiting field stars of similar metallicity, then detailedsimulations foresee the presence of 2-3 transiting planets. Instead, we do notconfirm the transit candidates proposed by Bruntt et al. (2003). Theprobability that the null detection is simply due to chance coincidence isestimated to be 3%-10%, depending on the metallicity assumed for the cluster.  Conclusions. Possible explanations of the null-detection of transits include:(i) a lower frequency of close-in planets in star clusters; (ii) a smallerplanetary radius for planets orbiting super metal rich stars; or (iii)limitations in the basic assumptions.

We confront this model with a range of high redshiftobservations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe thefollowing eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population withplausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of starformation: i-iv) the UV and Lya luminosity functions of LAEs at z=5.7 and 6.5,v-vi) the mean and variance of the EW distribution of Lya selected galaxies atz=5.7, vii) the EW distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) theobserved correlation of stellar age with EW. Our modeling suggests that theobserved anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of verymassive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of thegalaxies star forming lifetime. This very massive star formation may indicatethe presence of population-III star formation in a few per cent of i-dropgalaxies, and in about half of the Lya selected galaxies.",

First, we show that we can significantly improve search precisionby filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social networkthat includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilisticmodel that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topicscontained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly bedescribed by the tags they used for annotating their images.

A systematic, multiphysics basedmodelling approach is proposed. First, a nucleation coupled model fordegradation of the CNT thin film is derived, where the CNTs are assumed todecay by fragmentation and formation of clusters. The random orientation of theCNTs and the electromechanical interaction are then modeled to explain theself-assembly. The degraded state of the CNTs and the electromechanical forceare employed to update the orientation of the CNTs. Field emission current atthe device scale is finally obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation andintegration over the computational cell surfaces on the anode side. Thesimulated results are in close agreement with the experimental results.

We find that transition objects in Taurus occupya restricted region of the Mdot vs. Mdisc plane. Compared to non-transitionsingle stars in Taurus, they have stellar accretion rates that are typically~10 times lower at the same disc mass and median disc masses ~4 times larger.These properties are anticipated by several proposed planet formation theoriesand suggest that the formation of Jovian mass planets may play a significantrole in explaining the origin of at least some transition objects.

A quantum hologram has a higher storagecapacity compared to a classical hologram, and is capable of storing quantumfeatures of an image, such as multimode superposition and entangled quantumstates, something that a standard hologram is unable to achieve. Due to opticalparallelism, the information capacity of the quantum hologram will obviouslyexceed that of a single-mode scheme.",

        "abstract": "We have observed the ultra-compact low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 1A 1246-588with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). In this manuscript we report thediscovery of a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in 1A 1246-588. Thekilohertz QPO was only detected when the source was in a soft high-flux statereminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPOpeak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a singletrial significance of more than 7 sigma. Kilohertz QPOs with a higher frequencyhave only been found on two occasions in 4U 0614+09. Furthermore, the frequencyis higher than that found for the lower kilohertz QPO in any source, stronglysuggesting that the QPO is the upper of the kilohertz QPO pair often found inLMXBs. The full-width at half maximum is 25+-4 Hz, making the coherence thehighest found for an upper kilohertz QPO. From a distance estimate of ~6 kpcfrom a radius expansion burst we derive that 1A 1246-588 is at a persistentflux of ~0.2-0.3 per cent of the Eddington flux, hence 1A 1246-588 is one ofthe weakest LMXBs for which a kilohertz QPO has been detected. Theroot-mean-square (rms) amplitude in the 5-60 keV band is 27+-3 per cent, thisis the highest for any kilohertz QPO source so far, in line with the generalanti-correlation between source luminosity and rms amplitude of the kilohertzQPO peak identified before. Using the X-ray spectral information we produce acolour-colour diagram. The source behaviour in this diagram provides furtherevidence for the atoll nature of the source.",

In this paper, we first present an unified view of theseproofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processingargument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) anintegration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using theseingredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutualinformation inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher informationinequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\\'u used inearlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that itrelies only on the basic properties of mutual information.

These results are consistent with predictions of recent galaxyformation models, which incorporate AGN feedback to suppress star formation inthe most massive halos. Systematic studies of the relation of galaxies withtheir environment beyond z=1 are difficult, and still somewhat contradictory.Intriguingly both the DEEP2 and VVDS surveys find that the color-densityrelation disappears at z~1.3, unfortunately just at the point where bothsurveys become highly incomplete.

About 25% of our sample have strong PAH emission,but none are likely to be pure starbursts as reflected in their relatively high5um hot dust continua.

The velocity dispersion of the satellites is a good indicator ofthe virial velocity of the halo: \\sigma_{sat}/V_{vir}=0.9 +/- 0.2. Applied tothe Milky Way and M31 this gives V_{vir}^{MW}=109 +/- 22$ km/s andV_{vir}^{M31} = 138 +/- 35 km/s, respectively, substantially lower than therotation speed of their disk components. The detailed kinematics of simulatedsatellites and dark matter are also in good agreement. By contrast, the stellarhalo of the simulated galaxies is kinematically and spatially distinct from thepopulation of surviving satellites. This is because the survival of a satellitedepends on mass and on time of accretion; surviving satellites are biasedtoward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Ourresults support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differencesbetween stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive``building blocks'' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive,and were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs thathas survived self-bound until the present.",

The evolution of the main peaks in the velocity distributions can befollowed to an average age of approximately 9 Gyr.

Here we address the nature of theseheight fluctuations by means of straightforward atomistic Monte Carlosimulations based on a very accurate many-body interatomic potential forcarbon. We find that ripples spontaneously appear due to thermal fluctuationswith a size distribution peaked around 70 \\AA which is compatible withexperimental findings (50-100 \\AA) but not with the current understanding ofstability of flexible membranes. This unexpected result seems to be due to themultiplicity of chemical bonding in carbon.",

We show that for such a nonlinear expectation manyfundamental properties of a martingale can still make sense, including theDoob-Meyer type decomposition theorem and the optional sampling theorem. Moreimportantly, we show that any quadratic ${\\cal F}$-consistent nonlinearexpectation with a certain domination property must be a quadratic$g$-expectation.

Some of them are currently used in practicalapplications. The situation is different especially in EHL: the highestfriction coefficients are close to 10% when traction fluids are involved, i.e.fluids that have especially designed to transmit the highest friction, and theyvary within 3-6% for the rest of lubricants. The range of variation isconsequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared tothose obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a superlow traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially inthe case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales.

The governing Eulerian equations are solved using pseudo-spectralmethods on up to 512**3 computional grid points. DNS results for particleconcentration and enstrophy at Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers in the range34 - 170 were used to directly determine multiplier distributions (PDFs) onspatial scales 3 times the Kolmogorov length scale. The width of the PDFs,which is a measure of intermittency, decreases with increasing mass loadingwithin the local region where the multipliers are measured. The functional formof this dependence is not sensitive to Reynolds numbers in the rangeconsidered. A partition correlation probability is included in the cascademodel to account for the observed spatial anticorrelation between particleconcentration and enstrophy. Joint probability distribution functions ofconcentration and enstrophy generated using the cascade model are shown to bein excellent agreement with those derived directly from our 3D simulations.Probabilities predicted by the cascade model are presented at Reynolds numberswell beyond what is achievable by direct simulation. These results clearlyindicate that particle mass loading significantly reduces the probabilities ofhigh particle concentration and enstrophy relative to those resulting fromunloaded runs.

Theobservations we performed aim at improving our knowledge of the interferometricvisibility profile of Cepheids. In particular, we assess the systematicpresence of CSE around Cepheids in order determine accurate distances with theIBWM free from CSE biased angular diameters.

Coefficients areextracted by considering two-particle and triple unitarity cuts of thecorresponding bubble and triangle integral functions. After choosing a specificparameterisation of the cut loop momentum we can uniquely identify thecoefficients of the desired integral functions simply by examining thebehaviour of the cut integrand as the unconstrained parameters of the cut loopmomentum approach infinity. In this way we can produce compact forms for scalarintegral coefficients. Applications of this method are presented for both QCDand electroweak processes, including an alternative form for the recentlycomputed three-mass triangle coefficient in the six-photon amplitude$A_6(1^-,2^+,3^-,4^+,5^-,6^+)$. The direct nature of this extraction procedureallows for a very straightforward automation of the procedure.",

This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers fromconsiderations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linearBH-galaxy mass relation (MBH-Mgal) can naturally emerge regardless of howprimordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass functiondeclines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the MBH-Mgal relationis a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relationbecause of two basic statistical effects: a central limit-like tendency forgalaxy mergers which is much stronger for major mergers than minor mergers, anda convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. Acurious consequence of this thought experiment is that, if galaxy bulges areformed by major mergers, then merging statistics naturally show that MBH wouldcorrelate more strongly with bulge dominated galaxies, because of strongercentral-seeking tendencies, than with disk dominated galaxies. Even if someother physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear MBH-Mbulgerelationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, randommerging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen ratherthan weaken a pre-existing, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalizedto other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halo, compact nuclearobjects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.",

        "abstract": "In the density functional (DF) theory of Kohn and Sham, the kinetic energy ofthe ground state of a system of noninteracting electrons in a general externalfield is calculated using a set of orbitals. Orbital free methods attempt tocalculate this directly from the electron density by approximating theuniversal but unknown kinetic energy density functional. However simple localapproximations are inaccurate and it has proved very difficult to devisegenerally accurate nonlocal approximations. We focus instead on the kineticpotential, the functional derivative of the kinetic energy DF, which appears inthe Euler equation for the electron density. We argue that the kineticpotential is more local and more amenable to simple physically motivatedapproximations in many relevant cases, and describe two pathways by which thevalue of the kinetic energy can be efficiently calculated. We propose twononlocal orbital free kinetic potentials that reduce to known exact forms forboth slowly varying and rapidly varying perturbations and also reproduce exactresults for the linear response of the density of the homogeneous system tosmall perturbations. A simple and systematic approach for generating accurateand weak ab-initio local pseudopotentials which produce a smooth slowly varyingvalence component of the electron density is proposed for use in orbital freeDF calculations of molecules and solids. The use of these localpseudopotentials further minimizes the possible errors from the kineticpotentials. Our theory yields results for the total energies and ionizationenergies of atoms, and for the shell structure in the atomic radial densityprofiles that are in very good agreement with calculations using the fullKohn-Sham theory.",

It then attaches to whichever oneof these contacts is most desirable in some sense, such as its distance fromthe root or its degree. Even when the new node has just two choices, i.e., whenk=2, the resulting network can be very different from a random graph or tree.For instance, if the new node attaches to the contact which is closest to theroot of the tree, the distribution of depths changes from Poisson to atraveling wave solution. If the new node attaches to the contact with thesmallest degree, the degree distribution is closer to uniform than in a randomgraph, so that with high probability there are no nodes in the network withdegree greater than O(log log N). Finally, if the new node attaches to thecontact with the largest degree, we find that the degree distribution is apower law with exponent -1 up to degrees roughly equal to k, with anexponential cutoff beyond that; thus, in this case, we need k >> 1 to see apower law over a wide range of degrees.",

Functionallysimilar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations andcapacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any ofthese differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolutionfavors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficientlylarge. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selectionpressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show thatproteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towardshigher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolvegreater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance bothmutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness andstability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can bequantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutralnetwork.  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the generaltendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability inhighly polymorphic populations.

The latter occurrenceallows us to predict the pulsation phase interval during which observationsshould be made if successful abundance analysis is to be possible.",

        "abstract": "Hundreds of substellar companions to solar-type stars will be discovered withthe Kepler satellite. Kepler's extreme photometric precision gives access tolow-amplitude stellar variability contributed by a variety of physicalprocesses. We discuss in detail the periodic flux modulations arising from thetidal force on the star due to a substellar companion. An analytic expressionfor the variability is derived in the equilibrium-tide approximation. Wedemonstrate analytically and through numerical solutions of the linear,nonadiabatic stellar oscillation equations that the equilibrium-tide formulaworks extremely well for stars of mass <1.4 Msun with thick surface convectionzones. More massive stars with largely radiative envelopes do not conform tothe equilibrium-tide approximation and can exhibit flux variations $\\ga$10times larger than naive estimates. Over the full range of stellar massesconsidered, we treat the oscillatory response of the convection zone byadapting a prescription that A. J. Brickhill developed for pulsating whitedwarfs. Compared to other sources of periodic variability, the ellipsoidallightcurve has a distinct dependence on time and system parameters. We suggestthat ellipsoidal oscillations induced by giant planets may be detectable fromas many as ~100 of the 10^5 Kepler target stars. (Abridged)",

This allows sufficient separation of scales toobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertialrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports thepredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energyspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes ask^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in thesub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closurein the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist indifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling issubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsiblefor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with nointernal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANSattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology eitherfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining aformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fullyconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a directnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balancebetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS insteadof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANScontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallowerenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not precludeLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.",

However thedynamical evolution in the gravitational wave emission regime does. For thetypical range of mass ratios the final stage of the merger is preceded by arapid precession and a subsequent spin-flip of the main black hole. Thisalready occurs in the inspiral phase, therefore can be described analyticallyby post-Newtonian techniques. We then identify the radio galaxies with asuper-disk as those in which the rapidly precessing jet produces effectively apowerful wind, entraining the environmental gas to produce the appearance of athick disk.

Weexperimentally investigated the triboelectrification between two smoothmonocrystalline &#945;-Al 2O 3 (sapphire) antagonists by surface forcemeasurements with a Surface Force Apparatus (SFA). The force between a sphereand a plane, both in sapphire, was measured as a function of the sphere-planedistance D, before and after nano-friction tests, under dry argon atmosphere.Respective contributions of van der Waals, water meniscus and electrostaticforces were determined. The estimated Hamaker constant was in good agreementwith the Lifshitz theory, and the dominant meniscus attraction at lowseparation could be overcome with small radius sphere. We demonstrated thatelectrostatic forces were generated by the nano-friction test and we quantifiedthe adhesion that results from this contact-electrification. In the first stageof the unloading process, the short range electrostatic force was found to varyboth with time and distance D. Experimental results were correlated withsurface densities of mobile charges on the two surfaces, and thetime-dependence was related to classical surface transport phenomena on aluminasurfaces.",

Thechemical evolution models for Draco and Ursa Minor, which are able to reproduceseveral observational features of these two galaxies, such as the severalabundance ratios, take up-to-date nucleosynthesis into account forintermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect ofthese objects on the energetics of the systems. For both galaxies, the modelthat best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurringat a rate proportional to the star formation rate. Models with a wind rateassumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce theobserved SMD, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with nogalactic winds fail to reproduce the observed SMDs. In the case of Ursa Minor,the same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution verywell with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. The model forDraco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. The observed SMD requires amodel with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency ($\\eta_{SNeIa}$= 0.5 instead of $\\eta_{SNeIa}$ = 1.0) in order to delay the galactic wind,whereas all the other parameters are kept the same. The model results, comparedto observations, strongly suggest that intense and continuous galactic windsplay a very important role in the evolution of local dSphs.",

Light from a telescope is dispersed into multiple spectralorders, which are imaged separately, and two or more of the dispersed imagesare combined using an analogy between the (x,y,\\lambda) spectral data space andconventional (x,y,z) three-space. Because no photons are deliberately destroyedduring image acquisition, the technique is much more photon-efficient in someobserving regimes than existing techniques such as scanned-filtergraph orscanned-slit spectral imaging. Hybrid differential stereoscopy, which uses acombination of conventional cross-correlation stereoscopy and linearapproximation theory to extract the central wavelength of a spectral line, hasbeen used to produce solar Stokes-V (line-of-sight) magnetograms in the 617.34nm Fe I line, and more sophisticated inversion techniques are currently beingused to derive Doppler and line separation data from EUV images of the solarcorona collected in the neighboring lines of He-II and Si-XI at 30.4 nm.

While the quoted paperdeals with Wolf-Rayet stars which evolved through a red supergiant stage, weinvestigate here the initially more massive Wolf-Rayet stars which are thoughtto evolve through a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage. We perform hydrodynamicsimulations of the evolution of the circumstellar medium around a 60 Msol star,from the main sequence through the LBV and Wolf-Rayet stages, up to corecollapse. We then compute the column density of the circumstellar matter as afunction of radial velocity, time and angle. This allows a comparison with thenumber and blue-shifts, of absorption components in the spectra of LBVs,Wolf-Rayet stars, Type Ib/c supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows. Oursimulation for the post-LBV stage shows the formation of various absorptioncomponents, which are, however, rather short lived; they dissipate on timescales shorter than 50,000yr. As the LBV stage is thought to occur at thebeginning of core helium burning, the remaining Wolf-Rayet life time isexpected to be one order of magnitude larger. When interpreting the absorptioncomponents in the afterglow spectrum of GRB-021004 as circumstellar, it can beconcluded that the progenitor of this source did most likely not evolve throughan LBV stage.

We correlate the median radio flux densities against a range ofother sample properties, including median values for redshift, [OIII]luminosity, emission line ratios, and the strength of the 4000A break. Wedetect a strong trend for sources that are actively undergoing star-formationto have excess radio emission beyond the ~10^28 ergs/s/Hz level found forsources without any discernible star-formation. Furthermore, this additionalradio emission correlates well with the strength of the 4000A break in theoptical spectrum, and may be used to assess the age of the star-formingcomponent. We examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emissionline ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that havecharacteristic AGN ratios. This division also separates the mechanismresponsible for the radio emission (star-formation vs. AGN). For both cases wefind a strong, almost identical, correlation between [OIII] and radioluminosity, with the AGN sample extending toward lower, and the star-formationsample toward higher luminosities. A clearer separation between the twosubsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion of the hostgalaxy. For systems with similar redshifts and velocity dispersions, thestar-formation subsample is brighter than the AGN in the radio by an order ofmagnitude. This underlines the notion that the radio emission in star-formingsystems can dominate the emission associated with the AGN.",

By investigating residual covariance weintroduce lower dimensional tensors --generalizing to one side Kaluza-Kleingauge fields and to the other side extrinsic curvature and torsion of embeddedspaces-- fully characterizing the geometry of dimensional reduction. We obtaingeneral formulas for the reduction of the main tensors and operators ofRiemannian geometry. In particular, we provide what is probably the maximalpossible generalization of Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci equations and various otherstandard formulas in Kaluza-Klein and embedded spacetimes theories. Aftergeneral covariance breaking, part of the residual covariance is perceived byeffective lower dimensional observers as an infinite dimensional gauge group.This reduces to finite dimensions in Kaluza-Klein and other few remarkablebackgrounds, all characterized by the vanishing of appropriate lowerdimensional tensors.",

The X-ray spectrum canbe described by a power-law model with photon index Gamma = 2.8 and luminosityL_X \\approx 2.5*10^{29} ergs s^{-1} in the 0.3--8 keV band, for a plausibledistance of 500 pc and hydrogen column density N_H=3*10^{20} cm^{-2}.Alternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with kT ~ 0.22keV and projected emitting area ~2000 m^2. If the thermal X-rays are emittedfrom two symmetric polar caps, the bolometric luminosity of the two caps is 2L_bol ~ 3*10^{29} ergs s^{-1}. We compared our results with the data on other30 millisecond pulsars observed in X-rays and found that the apparent X-rayefficiency of PSR B1257+12, L_X/Edot ~ 3*10^{-5} for d=500 pc, is lower thanthose of most of millisecond pulsars. This might be explained by an unfavorableorientation of the X-ray pulsar beam if the radiation is magnetospheric, or bystrong asymmetry of polar caps if the radiation is thermal (e.g., one of thepolar caps is much brighter than the other and remains invisible for most partof the pulsar period). Alternatively, it could be attributed to absorption ofX-rays in circumpulsar matter, such as a flaring debris disk left over afterformation of the planetary system around the pulsar.",

The radio loudness of the AGN appears to be univocally related tothe host's brightness profile: radio-loud nuclei are only hosted by ``core''galaxies while radio-quiet AGN are only found in ``power-law'' galaxies. Weextend our analysis here to a sample of 42 nearby (V < 7000 km/s) Seyfertgalaxies hosted by early-type galaxies. We used the available HST images tostudy their brightness profiles. Having excluded complex and highly nucleatedgalaxies, in the remaining 16 objects the brightness profiles can besuccessfully modeled with a Nuker law with a steep nuclear cusp characteristicof ``power-law'' galaxies (with logarithmic slope 0.51 - 1.07). This result iswhat is expected for these radio-quiet AGN based on our previous findings, thusextending the validity of the connection between brightness profile and radioloudness to AGN of a far higher luminosity.

We conclude that, regardless ofthe modeling strategy, the dichotomy of AGN radio loudness can be univocallyrelated to the host's brightness profile.

Wedemonstrate that the BFKL Pomeron Calculus has two equivalent descriptions :(i) one is the generating functional which gives a clear probabilisticinterpretation of the processes of high energy scattering and also provides aHamiltonian-like description of the system of interacting dipoles; (ii) thesecond is the Langevin equation with a specific noise term which is rathercomplicated. We found that at high energies this Langevin equation can bereduced to the Langevin equation for directed percolation in the momentum spaceif the impact parameter is large, namely, $b>> 1/k$, where $k$ is thetransverse momentum of a dipole. Unfortunately, this simplified form ofLangevin equation is not applicable for summation of Pomeron loops, where oneintegrates over all possible values of impact parameter. We show that the BFKLPomeron calculus with two vertices (splitting $P\\to P+P$ and merging $P+P\\to P$of Pomerons) can be interpreted as a system of colourless dipoles with twoprocesses: the decay of one dipole into two and the merging of two dipoles intoone dipole.

In this paper we consider a graphene bilayer with a relative smallangle rotation between the layers and calculate the electronic structure nearzero energy in a continuum approximation. Contrary to what happens in a ABstacked bilayer and in accord with observations in epitaxial graphene we find:(a) the low energy dispersion is linear, as in a single layer, but the Fermivelocity can be significantly smaller than the single layer value; (b) anexternal electric field, perpendicular to the layers, does not open anelectronic gap",

In both lobes, the equipartitionmagnetic field (Beq) is bigger than the Inverse Compton value (Bic), calculatedfrom the radio and X-ray flux ratio. The Beq/Bic ratio never gets below 2, inspite of the large number of reasonable assumptions tested to calculate Beq,suggesting a lobe energetic dominated by particles. The X-ray data quality isgood enough to allow a spatially resolved analysis. Our study shows that Bicvaries through the lobes. It appears to increase behind the hot spots. On thecontrary, a rather uniform distribution of the particles is observed. As aconsequence, the radio flux density variation along the lobes appears to bemainly driven by magnetic field changes.",

Materials and methods: We have usedmicroplate spectrophotometry to measure the growth kinetics of hundreds ofindividual cell clones from the Molt3 cell line. The growth rate of each clonalpopulation has been estimated by fitting experimental data with the logisticequation. Results: The growth rates were observed to vary among differentclones. Up to six clones with a growth rate above or below the mean growth rateof the parent population were further cloned and the growth rates of theiroffsprings were measured. The distribution of the growth rates of the subclonesdid not significantly differ from that of the parent population thus suggestingthat growth variability has an epigenetic origin. To explain the observeddistributions of clonal growth rates we have developed a probabilistic modelassuming that the fluctuations in the number of mitochondria through successivecell cycles are the leading cause of growth variability. For fitting purposes,we have estimated experimentally by flow cytometry the maximum average numberof mitochondria in Molt3 cells. The model fits nicely the observeddistributions of growth rates, however, cells in which the mitochondria wererendered non functional (rho-0 cells) showed only a 30% reduction in the clonalgrowth variability with respect to normal cells. Conclusions: A tumor cellpopulation is a dynamic ensemble of clones with highly variable growth rate. Atleast part of this variability is due to fluctuations in the number ofmitochondria.",

By using the B-z, z-K colour-colour diagram (the BzKtechnique) we identify over 7500 candidate galaxies at z > 1.4, which can befurther separated into passive and starforming systems (pBzK and sBzKrespectively). Our unique sample allows us to identify a new feature notpreviously seen in BzK diagrams, consistent with the passively evolving trackof early type galaxies at z < 1.4. We also compare the BzK technique with theR-K colour selection of Extremely Red Objects (EROs) and the J-K selection ofDistant Red Galaxies (DRGs), and quantify the overlap between thesepopulations. We find that the majority of DRGs, at these relatively brightmagnitudes are also EROs. Since previous studies have found that DRGs at thesemagnitudes have redshifts of z ~ 1 we determine that these DRG/ERO galaxieshave SEDs consistent with being dusty star-forming galaxies or AGN at z < 2.Finally we observe a flattening in the number counts of pBzK galaxies, similarto other studies, which may indicate that we are sampling the luminosityfunction of passive z > 1 galaxies over a narrow redshift range.",

Depending on inclination, the B-bandattenuation correction varies from 0.2 -- 1.1 mag for discs and from 0.8 -- 2.6mag for bulges. We find that, overall, 37 per cent of all B-band photonsproduced in discs in the nearby universe are absorbed by dust, a figure thatrises to 71 per cent for bulge photons. The severity of internal dustextinction is such that one must incorporate internal dust corrections in alloptical studies of large galaxy samples.

        "abstract": "The description of the statistical properties of dust emission givesimportant constraints on the physics of the interstellar medium but it is alsoa useful way to estimate the contamination of diffuse interstellar emission inthe cases where it is considered a nuisance. The main goals of this analysis ofthe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of 100 micron dust emission are1) to estimate the power spectrum of interstellar matter density in threedimensions, 2) to review and extend previous estimates of the cirrus noise dueto dust emission and 3) to produce simulated dust emission maps that reproducethe observed statistical properties. The main results are the following. 1) Thecirrus noise level as a function of brightness has been previouslyoverestimated. It is found to be proportional to <I> instead of <I>^1.5, where<I> is the local average brightness at 100 micron. This scaling is inaccordance with the fact that the brightness fluctuation level observed at agiven angular scale on the sky is the sum of fluctuations of increasingamplitude with distance on the line of sight. 2) The spectral index of dustemission at scales between 5 arcmin and 12.5 degrees is <gamma>=-2.9 on averagebut shows significant variations over the sky. Bright regions havesystematically steeper power spectra than diffuse regions. 3) The skewness andkurtosis of brightness fluctuations is high, indicative of strongnon-Gaussianity. 4) Based on our characterization of the 100 micron powerspectrum we provide a prescription of the cirrus confusion noise as a functionof wavelength and scale. 5) Finally we present a method based on a modificationof Gaussian random fields to produce simulations of dust maps which reproducethe power spectrum and non-Gaussian properties of interstellar dust emission.",

        "abstract": "(Abridged) Luminous Compact Galaxies (LCGs) (M_B < -20, R_{1/2} < 4.5kpc andEW_{0}(OII) >15\\AA) constitute one of the most rapidly evolving galaxypopulations over the last ~8 Gyr history of the universe. Due to theirinherently compact sizes, any detailed quantitative analysis of theirmorphologies has proved to be difficult in the past. In this work we use thehigh angular resolution imaging data, from the HST/ACS GOODS survey, to studythe quantitative morphology of a complete sample of LCGs in the redshift range0.5 < z < 1.2. We have derived structural parameters for a representativesample of 39 LCGs selected from the GOODS-S field, using full 2-dimensionalsurface brightness profile fitting of the galaxy images in each of the fourfilters available. B-z color maps are used as an aid in the morphologicalclassification. We then use the rest frame B band bulge flux fraction (B/T) todetermine the morphological class of the galaxies. Mergers were essentiallyidentified visually by the presence of multiple maxima of comparable intensityin the rest frame B band images, aided by the color maps to distinguish themfrom HII regions. We derive the following morphological mix for our sample ofintermediate redshift LCGs: Mergers: ~36%, Disk dominated: ~22%, S0: ~20%,Early types: ~7%, Irr/tadpole: ~15%. We establish that our sample LCGs areintermediate mass objects with a median stellar mass of Log(M/M_{\\odot})=10.32.We also derive dust enshrouded SFR values ranging from a few to ~65$M_{\\odot}$/year using Spitzer 24$\\mu m$ data. We estimate a factor ~11 fall inthe comoving number density of blue LCGs from redshifts 0.5 < z < 1.2 to thecurrent epoch. We finally discuss the evolutionary scenario of these LCGs whichmight give us some clues regarding their descendants in the local universe.",

Most of the detected linetransitions have proven strong enough to map in several sources, providing acomprehensive picture of the relative distribution of the various lineemissions observable in the Spitzer/IRS bandpass. A principal componentanalysis of the spectral line maps reveals that the observed emission linesfall into five distinct groups, each of which may exhibit a distinct spatialdistribution: (1) lines of S and H2 (J > 2); (2) the H2 S(0) line; (3) lines ofions with appearance potentials less than 13.6 eV; (4) lines of ions withappearance potentials greater than 13.6 eV, not including S++; (5) lines ofS++. Lines of group (1) likely originate in molecular material subject to aslow, nondissociative shock that is driven by the overpressure within thesupernova remnant, and lines in groups (3) - (5) are associated primarily withdissociative shock fronts with a range of (larger) shock velocities. The H2S(0) line shows a low-density diffuse emission component, and - in some sources- a shock-excited component.",

However, the sparseness of our data, prevents amore precise characterization of the light-curves, and we can not determinewether they are one-peaked or two-peaked. Hence, these periods and amplitudeshave to be considered preliminary estimates. As for Setebos, Stephano andTrinculo the present data do not allow to derive any unambiguous periodicity,despite Setebos displays a significant variability with amplitude about aslarge as that of Prospero.

The present GRB samples with redshiftdetermination are largely incomplete and therefore a careful analysis ofselection effects is mandatory before any conclusion can be drawn from theobserved GRB redshift distribution. We study and compare three well definedsamples of long GRBs detected by Swift, HETE2 and BeppoSAX. We find that SwiftGRBs are slighly fainter and harder than BeppoSAX and HETE2 GRBs, as expecteddue to the higher energy range in which Swift GRBs are detected and localized,compared to BeppoSAX and HETE2. Gas and dust obscuration plays a role inshaping the GRB samples and the present samples of GRBs with redshift. We arguethat the majority of the bright Swift GRBs without redshift might actually bez<~2 events therefore the present Swift GRB sample with redshift is biasedagainst low-z GRBs. On the other hand, the detection of bright UV rest-frameafterglows from high-z GRBs, and even from those with large X-ray obscuration,implies a dust amount lower than in nearby GRBs,and/or a different dustcomposition. If this is the case, the Swift sample of GRBs with redshifts isprobably a fair sample of the real high-z GRB population. The absence of high-zGRBs in the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples of GRBs with redshifts is probably dueto the fact at the time of BeppoSAX and HETE2 follow-up faint afterglows ofhigh redshift GRBs will have weaken below the spectroscopic capabilities ofeven 10m class telescopes. The redshift distribution of a subsample of SwiftGRBs with distributions of peak-fluxes, X-ray obscuration and optical magnitudeat a fixed observing time similar to those of the BeppoSAX and HETE2 samples,is roughly consistent with BeppoSAX+HETE2 redshift distribution.",

Using arigorous eigenfunction expansion method, we obtain a closed-form expression forthe Green's function describing the upscattering of monochromatic radiationinjected into the column. The Green's function is convolved withbremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and blackbody source terms to calculate the emergentphoton spectrum. We show that energization of photons in the shock naturallyproduces an X-ray spectrum with a relatively flat continuum and a high-energyexponential cutoff.

Accurate photometry(especially for faint sources) requires two simple processing steps beyond thestandard data reduction to remove long-term detector transients. Point spreadfunction (PSF) fitting photometry is found to give more accurate flux densitiesthan aperture photometry. Based on the PSF fitting photometry, the calibrationfactor shows no strong trend with flux density, background, spectral type,exposure time, or time since anneals. The coarse-scale calibration sampleincludes observations of stars with flux densities from 22 mJy to 17 Jy, onbackgrounds from 4 to 26 MJy sr^-1, and with spectral types from B to M. Thecoarse-scale calibration is 702 +/- 35 MJy sr^-1 MIPS70^-1 (5% uncertainty) andis based on measurements of 66 stars. The instrumental units of the MIPS 70micron coarse- and fine-scale imaging modes are called MIPS70 and MIPS70F,respectively. The photometric repeatability is calculated to be 4.5% from twostars measured during every MIPS campaign and includes variations on all timescales probed. The preliminary fine-scale calibration factor is 2894 +/- 294MJy sr^-1 MIPS70F^-1 (10% uncertainty) based on 10 stars. The uncertainty inthe coarse- and fine-scale calibration factors are dominated by the 4.5%photometric repeatability and the small sample size, respectively. The 5-sigma,500 s sensitivity of the coarse-scale observations is 6-8 mJy.

Using StarSpotz, aprogram developed specifically to analyze MOST photometry, we have solved fork, the differential rotation coefficient, and P_{EQ}, the equatorial rotationperiod using the light curves from all three years. The spots range in latitudefrom 10 to 75 degrees and k = 0.090^{+0.006}_{-0.005} -- less than the solarvalue but consistent with the younger age of the star. k is also wellconstrained by the independent spectroscopic estimate of vsini.

Details are given of the parallel tempering formalism used in finding themost robust solution which gives P_{EQ} = 8.77^{+0.03}_{-0.04} days -- smallerthan that usually adopted, implying an age < 750 My. Our values of P_{EQ} and kcan explain the range of rotation periods determined by others by spots oractivity at a variety of latitudes. Historically, Ca II activity seems to occurconsistently between latitudes 50 and 60 degrees which might indicate apermanent magnetic feature. Knowledge of k and P_{EQ} are key to understandingthe dynamo mechanism and rotation structure in the convective zone as wellassessing age for solar-type stars.

Different optical width estimators areconsidered and their limitations discussed, with emphasis on biases associatedwith rotation curve properties (shape and extent) and disk central surfacebrightness. The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained withPolyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixedfraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotationcurve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measuredat 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount thatcorrelates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occursbecause the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15r_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases withincreasing disk surface brightness. Statistical corrections, parameterized bythe radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce Polyexand HI width measurements into a homogeneous system.

        "abstract": "Electroweak theory joins electromagnetism with the weak force in a singlequantum field theory, ascribing the two fundamental interactions--so differentin their manifestations--to a common symmetry principle. How the electroweakgauge symmetry is hidden is one of the most urgent and challenging questionsfacing particle physics. The provisional answer incorporated in the \"standardmodel\" of particle physics was formulated in the 1960s by Higgs, by Brout &Englert, and by Guralnik, Hagen & Kibble: The agent of electroweak symmetrybreaking is an elementary scalar field whose self-interactions select a vacuumstate in which the full electroweak symmetry is hidden, leaving a residualphase symmetry of electromagnetism. By analogy with the Meissner effect of thesuperconducting phase transition, the Higgs mechanism, as it is commonly known,confers masses on the weak force carriers W and Z. It also opens the door tomasses for the quarks and leptons, and shapes the world around us. It is a goodstory--though an incomplete story--and we do not know how much of the story istrue. Experiments that explore the Fermi scale (the energy regime around 1 TeV)during the next decade will put the electroweak theory to decisive test, andmay uncover new elements needed to construct a more satisfying completion ofthe electroweak theory. The aim of this article is to set the stage byreporting what we know and what we need to know, and to set some \"BigQuestions\" that will guide our explorations.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on supergravity duals of BPS states in N=4 superYang-Mills. In order to describe these duals, we begin with a sequence ofbreathing mode reductions of IIB supergravity: first on S^3, then S^3 x S^1,and finally on S^3 x S^1 x CP^1. We then follow with a complete supersymmetryanalysis, yielding 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 BPS configurations, respectively (where inthe last step we take the Hopf fibration of S^3). The 1/8 BPS geometries, whichhave an S^3 isometry and are time-fibered over a six-dimensional base, aredetermined by solving a non-linear equation for the Kahler metric on the base.Similarly, the 1/4 BPS configurations have an S^3 x S^1 isometry and afour-dimensional base, whose Kahler metric obeys another non-linear,Monge-Ampere type equation.  Despite the non-linearity of the problem, we develop a universal bubbling AdSdescription of these geometries by focusing on the boundary conditions whichensure their regularity. In the 1/8 BPS case, we find that the S^3 cycleshrinks to zero size on a five-dimensional locus inside the six-dimensionalbase. Enforcing regularity of the full solution requires that the interior of asmooth, generally disconnected five-dimensional surface be removed from thebase. The AdS_5 x S^5 ground state corresponds to excising the interior of anS^5, while the 1/8 BPS excitations correspond to deformations (includingtopology change) of the S^5 and/or the excision of additional droplets from thebase. In the case of 1/4 BPS configurations, by enforcing regularityconditions, we identify three-dimensional surfaces inside the four-dimensionalbase which separate the regions where the S^3 shrinks to zero size from thosewhere the S^1 shrinks.",

        "abstract": "GRB 060614 is a remarkable GRB observed by Swift with puzzling properties,which challenge current progenitor models. The lack of any bright SN down tovery strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,strikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we presentspectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that theburst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic breakis observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with thebreak in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviourand the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the bestexamples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglowlight curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there isstrong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a breakfrequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early timesand the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying athigher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-raylight curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extendedemission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show thatthe Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRTobservation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exitsit at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24keV but larger than 8 keV. The initial peak observed by BAT is howeverdistinctly harder than the rest with Ep ~300 keV as measured by Konus Wind.Considering the time-averaged spectral properties, GRB 060614 is consistentwith the Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations.",

The LBGs without Ly-alpha emissionform a filamentary structure including the QSO, while the LAEs are distributedaround the QSO but avoid it within a distance of ~4.5Mpc. On the other hand, weserendipitously discovered a protocluster with a significant concentration ofLBGs and LAEs where no strongly UV ionizing source such as a QSO or radiogalaxy is known to exist. In this cluster field, two populations are spatiallycross-correlated with each other. The relative spatial distribution of LAEs toLBGs is in stark contrast between the QSO and the cluster fields. We also founda weak trend showing that the number counts based on Ly-alpha and UV continuumfluxes of LAEs in the QSO field are slightly lower than in the cluster field,whereas the number counts of LBGs are almost consistent with each other. TheLAEs avoid the nearby region around the QSO where the local UV backgroundradiation could be ~100 times stronger than the average for the epoch. Theclustering segregation between LBGs and LAEs seen in the QSO field could be dueto either enhanced early galaxy formation in an overdense environment havingcaused all the LAEs to evolve into LBGs, or local photoionization due to thestrong UV radiation from the QSO effectively causing a deficit in low-massgalaxies like LAEs.",

Reionization increases the measured clustering of emitters,and we show that this enhancement would be essentially impossible to attributeto anything other than reionization. Our results motivate looking for thesignature of reionization in existing LAE data. We find that for stellarreionization scenarios the angular correlation function of the 58 LAEs in theSubaru Deep Field z = 6.6 photometric sample is more consistent with a fullyionized universe (mean volume ionized fraction x_i = 1) than a universe withx_i < 0.5 at >2-sigma confidence level. Measurements in the next year on Subaruwill increase their z = 6.6 LAE sample by a factor of five and tighten theselimits. If the clustering signature of reionization is detected in a LAEsurvey, a comparison with a Lyman-break or a H-alpha survey in the same fieldwould confirm the reionization hypothesis.

Since the pulsed emission of the jet creates internal shocksand since the jet velocity is very high, the jet bow shock and the internalshocks are heated to high temperatures and should therefore emit X-rayradiation. In this paper, we investigate in detail the X-ray properties of thejets in our models. We have focused our study on the total X-ray luminosity andits temporal variability, the resulting spectra and the spatial distribution ofthe emission. Temperature and density maps from our hydrodynamical simulationswith radiative cooling presented in the second paper are used together withemissivities calculated with the atomic database ATOMDB. The jets in our modelsshow extended and variable X-ray emission which can be characterized as a sumof hot and warm components with temperatures that are consistent withobservations of CH Cyg and R Aqr. The X-ray spectra of our model jets showemission line features which correspond to observed features in the spectra ofCH Cyg. The innermost parts of our pulsed jets show iron line emission in the6.4 - 6.7 keV range which may explain such emission from the central source inR Aqr.

As a consequence, both the Entropyand Relative Entropy method cannot be straightforwardly applied to prove thehydrodynamic limit. In particular, some care should be put when proving the Oneand Two block Lemmas which guarantee local convergence to equilibrium. We showthat, for initial profiles smooth enough and bounded away from zero and one,the macroscopic density profile for our KCLG evolves under the diffusive timescaling according to the porous medium equation. Then we prove the same resultfor more general profiles for a slightly perturbed dynamics obtained by addingjumps of the Symmetric Simple Exclusion. The role of the latter is to removethe degeneracy of rates and at the same time they are properly slowed down inorder not to change the macroscopic behavior. The equilibrium fluctuations andthe magnitude of the spectral gap for this perturbed model are also obtained.",

The progenitor suffered an LBV-likeoutburst just 2 yr earlier, and we propose that the dust formation is aconsequence of the SN blast wave overtaking that LBV-like shell. The keyevidence for dust formation is (a) the appearance of a red/near-IR continuumsource fit by 1600 K graphite grains, and (b) fading of the redshifted sides ofHe I emission lines, yielding progressively more asymmetric blueshifted linesas dust obscures receding material. This provides the strongest case yet fordust formation in any SN Ib/c. Both developments occurred between 51 and 75 dafter peak, while other SNe observed to form dust did so after a few hundreddays. Geometric considerations indicate that dust formed in the dense swept-upshell between the forward and reverse shocks, and not in the freely expandingSN ejecta. Rapid cooling leading to dust formation may have been aided byextremely high shell densities, as indicated by He I line ratios. The briefepoch of dust formation is accompanied by He II 4686 emission and enhancedX-ray emission. These clues suggest that the unusual dust formation in thisobject was not due to properties of the SN itself, but instead -- like mostpeculiarities of SN 2006jc -- was a consequence of the dense environmentcreated by an LBV-like eruption 2 yr before the SN.",

This refutesprevious claims of large timing irregularities in these data. In the dipolespin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limit on period derivative implies anenergy loss rate < 1.5E32 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 3.5E11G, and characteristic age tau > 24 Myr.

Quiteinterestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous inthe current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additivechannel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it isshown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacityto the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of thewiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to aprivate key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novelfeedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (evenwhen the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destinationchannel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property ofthe channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption overthe channel without revealing its key to the source.

The armchair edgeGNR channel shares similarities with a zigzag CNT, but it has a differentgeometry and quantum confinement boundary condition in the transversedirection. The results indicate that the I-V characteristics are ambipolar andstrongly depend on the GNR width because the bandgap of the GNR isapproximately inversely proportional to its width, which agrees with recentexperiments.

Reducing the oxide thickness is moreuseful for improving transistor performance than using a high-k gate insulator.Significant increase of the minimal leakage current is observed when thechannel length is scaled below 10nm because the small effective massfacilitates strong source-drain tunneling.

This may be the first identification of the systematicvariation of the FP slope among the subclasses of early-type galaxies. Thedifference in the FP slope might be caused by the difference in the degree ofnonhomology among different classes or by the difference of gas contents intheir merging progenitors. One possible scenario is that the AGN host galaxiesand star-forming galaxies are formed by gas-rich merging and that they mayevolve into normal early-type galaxies after finishing their star formation orAGN activities.",

        "abstract": "The energy density of the universe today may be dominated by the vacuumenergy of a slowly rolling scalar field. Making a quantum expansion around sucha time dependent solution is found to break fundamental symmetries of quantumfield theory. We call this mechanism cosmological symmetry breaking and arguethat it is different from the standard phenomenon of spontaneous symmetrybreaking. We illustrate this with a toy scalar field theory, whose actiondisplays a U(1) symmetry. We identify a symmetry, called pseudo-scaleinvariance, which sets the cosmological constant exactly equal to zero, both inclassical and quantum theory. This symmetry is also broken cosmologically andleads to a nonzero vacuum or dark energy. The slow roll condition along withthe observed value of dark energy leads to a value of the background scalarfield of the order of Planck mass. We also consider a U(1) gauge symmetrymodel. Cosmological symmetry breaking, in this case, leads to a non zero massfor the vector field. We also show that a cosmologically broken pseudo-scaleinvariance can generate a wide range of masses.",

Numerical results arepresented for a number of unstable modes in a model of SPB star, at rotationrates up to 250 km/s. It is shown that rotation has a large effect on modevisibility in light and in mean radial velocity variations. In most cases, fastrotation impairs mode detectability of g-modes in light variation, as Townsend(2003b) has already noted, but it helps detection in radial velocity variation.The mixed modes, which exist only at sufficiently fast rotation, are also moreeasily seen in radial velocity. The amplitude ratios and phase differences arestrongly dependent on the aspect, the rotational velocity and on the mode. Thelatter dependence is essential for mode identification.",

Theobservations suggest that large grains are produced relatively early in diskevolution (< 1 Myr) and remain at large radii for longer periods of time (5 to10 Myr). Simple theoretical estimates of the radial drift time of solidparticles, however, imply that they would drift inward over a time scale ofless than 0.1 Myr. In this paper, we address this conflict between theory andobservation, using more detailed theoretical models, including the effects ofsedimentation, collective drag forces and turbulent viscosity. We find that,although these effects slow down the radial drift of the dust particles, thisreduction is not sufficient to explain the observationally determined longsurvival time of mm/cm-sized grains in protoplanetary disks. However, if forsome reason the gas to dust ratio in the disk is reduced by at least a factorof 20 from the canonical value of 100 (for instance through photoevaporation ofthe gas), then the radial drift time scales become sufficiently large to be inagreement with observations.",

When coupled with data of other two TO stars of the cluster,available in the literature, the full range in Li abundances observed in thiscluster is 1.6<~A(Li)<~ 2.3. The variation in A(Li) is at least 0.6 dex (0.7dex considering also the data available in the literature) and the scatter issix times larger than what expected from the observational error. We claim thatthese variations are real. A(Li) seems to be anti-correlated with A(Na) exactlyas observed in NGC 6752. No systematic error in our analysis could produce suchan anti-correlation. conclusions: Na production through p captures on 22Ne attemperatures in excess of 3x10^7 K and the contemporary Li destruction couldresult in this anti-correlation. However such nuclear processing cannot havetaken place in the stars themselves, which do not reach such high temperatures,even at their centre. This points towards the processing in a previousgeneration of stars. The low N/O ratios in the observed stars and the apparentlack of correlation between N an Li abundances, place a strong constraint onthe properties of this previous generation. Our results indicate a differentbehaviour among the Globular Clusters so far studied as far as the abundancepatterns are concerned.",

        "abstract": "We discuss the difficulties of predicting the solar cycle using mean-fieldmodels. Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significantmodulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owingto either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implicationsfor predictability in both of these situations by considering two separatesolar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed fluxtransport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise tosignificant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a lossof predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects andassume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fullydeterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario forprediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (withparameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a targettimeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required topredict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct inall details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that evenshort-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in theinput parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if thepredicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles.Given the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients andnonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predictingthe solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.",

Of interest is how the maximum throughput achieved bythe cognitive users scales with n. Furthermore, how far these users must befrom a primary user to guarantee a given primary outage. Two scenarios areconsidered for the network scaling law: (i) when each cognitive transmitteruses constant power to communicate with a cognitive receiver at a boundeddistance away, and (ii) when each cognitive transmitter scales its poweraccording to the distance to a considered primary user, allowing the cognitivetransmitter-receiver distances to grow. Using single-hop transmission, suitablefor cognitive devices of opportunistic nature, we show that, in both scenarios,with path loss larger than 2, the cognitive network throughput scales linearlywith the number of cognitive users. We then explore the radius of a primaryexclusive region void of cognitive transmitters. We obtain bounds on thisradius for a given primary outage constraint. These bounds can help in thedesign of a primary network with exclusive regions, outside of which cognitiveusers may transmit freely.

Our aim is not just to provide a functionalfor a new, admittedly academic, model, but to investigate the structure offundamental measure theory. A model of aligned hard hexagons has similaritieswith the hard disk model. Both share \"lost cases\", i.e. admit configurations ofthree particles in which there is pairwise overlap but not triple overlap.These configurations are known to be problematic for fundamental measurefunctionals, which are not able to capture their contribution correctly. Thisfailure lies in the inability of these functionals to yield a correct lowdensity limit of the third order direct correlation function. Here we derivethe functional by projecting aligned hard cubes on the plane x+y+z=0. Thecorrect dimensional crossover behavior of these functionals permits us tofollow this strategy. The functional of aligned hard cubes, however, does nothave lost cases, so neither had the resulting functional for aligned hardhexagons. The latter exhibits, in fact, a peculiar structure as compared to theone for hard disks. It depends on a uniparametric family of weighted densitiesthrough a new term not appearing in the functional for hard disks. Apart fromstudying the freezing of this system, we discuss the implications of thefunctional structure for new developments of fundamental measure theory.",

Present models can only account for the inhomogeneity ofstellar winds in the approximation of small-scale structures that are opticallythin. This treatment of ``microclumping'' has led to reducing empiricalmass-loss rates by factors of two and more. Aims: Stellar wind clumps can beoptically thick in spectral lines. We investigate how this ``macroclumping''impacts on empirical mass-loss rates. Methods: The Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR)model atmosphere code is generalized in the ``formal integral'' to account forclumps that are not necessarily optically thin. Results: Optically thick clumpsreduce the effective opacity. This has a pronounced effect on the emergentspectrum. Our modeling for the O-type supergiant zeta Puppis reveals that theoptically thin H-alpha line is not affected by wind porosity, but that the PVresonance doublet becomes significantly weaker when macroclumping is taken intoaccount. The reported discrepancies between resonance-line andrecombination-line diagnostics can be resolved entirely with the macroclumpingmodeling without downward revision of the mass-loss rate. Conclusions:Mass-loss rates inferred from optically thin emission, such as the H-alpha linein O stars, are not influenced by macroclumping. The strength of opticallythick lines, however, is reduced because of the porosity effects. Therefore,neglecting the porosity in stellar wind modeling can lead to underestimatingempirical mass-loss rates.",

In contrast, the time of flux density maximum is progressivelydelayed with decreasing frequency. The decay phase is independent of radiofrequency. The simple source morphology and the excellent spectral coverage atradio wavelengths allowed us to employ a nonlinear chi-squared minimizationscheme to fit the time series of radio spectra to a source model that accountsfor the observed radio emission in terms of gyrosynchrotron radiation fromMeV-energy electrons in a relatively dense thermal plasma.

I first show that, within this model, usingthe Fundamental Plane relationship reduces the (systematic+random) errors inmass estimates to 14%, from 22% for a simple mass-flux relationship. Sincemeasurement of the cluster sizes is an inevitable part of observing the SZclusters, the Fundamental Plane relationship can be used to reduce the error ofthe cluster mass estimates by ~ 34%, improving the accuracy of the resultingcosmological constraints without any extra cost. I then argue why ourFundamental Plane is distinctly different from the virial relationship that onemay naively expect between the cluster parameters. Finally, I argue that whileincluding more details of the observed SZ profile cannot significantly improvethe accuracy of mass estimates, a better understanding of the impact ofnon-gravitational heating/cooling processes on the outskirts of theintracluster medium (apart from external calibrations) might be the best way toreduce these errors.",

Wepresent a maximum-likelihood method of determining the intrinsic spectral indexdistribution (ISID) of a population of gamma-ray emitters which accounts forerror in measurement of individual spectral indices, and we apply it to EGRETblazars. We find that the most likely Gaussian ISID for EGRET blazars has amean of 2.27 and a standard deviation of 0.20. We additionally find someindication that FSRQs and BL Lacs may have different ISIDs (with BL Lacs beingharder). We also test for spectral index hardening associated with blazarvariability for which we find no evidence. Finally, we produce simulated GLASTspectral index datasets and perform the same analyses. With improved statisticsdue to the much larger number of resolvable blazars, GLAST data will help usdetermine the ISIDs with much improved accuracy. Should any difference existbetween the ISIDs of BL Lacs and FSRQs or between the ISIDs of blazars in thequiescent and flaring states, GLAST data will be adequate to separate theseISIDs at a significance better than 3 sigma.",

Themain difference to previous SAMs is that we include 'gravitational' heating ofthe intra-cluster medium (ICM) by the net surplus of gravitational potentialenergy released from gas that has been stripped from infalling satellites.Gravitational heating appears to be an efficient heating source able to preventcooling in environments corresponding to dark matter halos more massive than$\\sim 10^{13} $M$_{\\odot}$. The energy release by gravitational heating canmatch that by AGN-feedback in massive galaxies and can exceed it in the mostmassive ones. However, there is a fundamental difference in the way the twoprocesses operate. Gravitational heating becomes important at late times, whenthe peak activity of AGNs is already over, and it is very mass dependent.

It is possible, even likely, thatterrestrial planets in other planetary systems have undergone similar changes;consequently, the age distribution of nearby stars is an importantconsideration in designing surveys for Earth-analogues. Valenti & Fischer(2005) provide age and metallicity estimates for 1039 FGK dwarfs in the SolarNeighbourhood. Using the Hipparcos catalogue as a reference to calibratepotential biases, we have extracted volume-limited samples of nearby stars fromthe Valenti-Fischer dataset. Unlike other recent investigations, our analysisshows clear evidence for an age-metallicity relation in the local disk, albeitwith substantial dispersion at any epoch. The mean metallicity increases from-0.3 dex at a lookback time of ~10 Gyrs to +0.15 dex at the present day.Supplementing the Valenti-Fischer measurements with literature data to give acomplete volume-limited sample, the age distribution of nearby FGK dwarfs isbroadly consistent with a uniform star-formation rate over the history of theGalactic disk. In striking contrast, most stars known to have planetarycompanions are younger than 5 Gyrs; however, stars with planetary companionswithin 0.4 AU have a significantly flatter age distribution, indicating thatthose systems are stable on timescales of many Gyrs. Several of the older,lower metallicity host stars have enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios, implyingmembership of the thick disk. If the frequency of terrestrial planets is alsocorrelated with stellar metallicity, then the median age of such planetarysystem is likely to be ~3 Gyrs.

Our method,which involves the two-sided irradiation of the vibrating mirror inside anoptical cavity, combines several advantages over the two-mirror arrangementsbeing used currently. For comparable parameters the three-mirror configurationprovides a stiffer trap for the oscillating mirror. Furthermore it preventsbistability from limiting the use of higher laser powers for mirror trapping,and also partially does so for mirror cooling. Lastly, it improves theisolation of the mirror from classical noise so that its dynamics are perturbedmostly by the vacuum fluctuations of the optical fields.

Whether these transcription factorslocate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter ofspeculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when theprotein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In thispaper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by consideringa very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number oflow affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites,corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip.We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modesby considering three different types of molecules: a walker that randomly walksalong the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation andthen re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; anda hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and thenre-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the finalprobability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs canlocate their targets fast enough even if they spend 15% of their search timediffusing freely in the solution.

Specifically, we propose aphysical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions amongnodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs codingarithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes useof the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) wavesfor equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission andstraightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. Morespecifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double thatof traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higherthan 0dB). We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-basednetwork coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential forboosting network capacity.",

Independent determinations of w(\\theta) as afunction of magnitude limit are presented for both the HST ACS catalog and alsofor the ground-based data from Subaru and the CFHT. Despite havingsignificantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. At brightmagnitudes (IAB<22), our data generally match very well with existingmeasurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formationcalculations of Kitzbichler and White from the Millennium Simulation. Theexception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmicvariance scatter for \\theta > 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularlyrich structure known to exist at z~0.8. For fainter samples, however, the levelof clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in allthree catalogues we find w(\\theta=1')~0.014 at a median IAB magnitude of 24. Atthese very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latestdeterminations from the Canada-France Legacy Survey. This level of clusteringis approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at allangles). The semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, whichis too small to account for the discrepancy.

The differences between this wind model and previousPrimakoff-type simulations are described. A more complex structure, even in 1D,is revealed through the presence of both forward and reverse shocks, with aseparating contact discontinuity. The effects of radiative cooling areinvestigated and key outburst parameters such as mass-loss rate, ejectavelocity and mass are varied. The shock velocities as a function of time arecompared to the ones derived in Paper I.

There is indeed no scale to stop the blue-shifting effectencountered in the backward propagation towards the event horizon. On thecontrary, when taking into account the gravitational interactions neglected inthe semi-classical treatment, a UV scale stopping the blue-shift could bedynamically engendered. To show that this is the case, we use anon-perturbative treatment based on the large-N limit, where $N$ is the numberof matter fields. In this limit, the semi-classical treatment is the leadingcontribution. Non-linear gravitational effects appear in the next orders and inthe first of these, the effects are governed by the two-point correlationfunction of the energy-momentum tensor evaluated in the vacuum. Taking thiscorrelator into account, backward propagated modes are dissipated at a distancefrom the horizon $\\propto G\\kappa$ when measured in a freely falling frame.($G$ is Newton's constant and $\\kappa$ the surface gravity.)

The study of diffusion on such networks ismotivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronizationproblems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport onnetworks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a richphase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context ofrandom walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:in the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, andin the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to themotion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established thatin a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small densityof, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interactiontopology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In somecases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in theEdwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. Thisbreak-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, wherethe mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of anaive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are alsoconfirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of thenetwork Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework forthe relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finitenetworks.

It was found that the volumeentropy provides a good mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy because itsatisfies the heat theorem and it is an adiabatic invariant. This propertyexplains the ``equal'' sign in Clausius principle ($S_f \\geq S_i$) in a purelymechanical way and suggests that the volume entropy might explain the ``largerthan'' sign (i.e. the Law of Entropy Increase) if non adiabatic transformationswere considered. Based on the principles of microscopic (quantum or classical)mechanics here we prove that, provided the initial equilibrium satisfy thenatural condition of decreasing ordering of probabilities, the expectationvalue of the volume entropy cannot decrease for arbitrary transformationsperformed by some external sources of work on a insulated system. This can beregarded as a rigorous quantum mechanical proof of the Second Law. We discusshow this result relates to the Minimal Work Principle and improves overprevious attempts. The natural evolution of entropy is towards larger valuesbecause the natural state of matter is at positive temperature.

Particleinterferometry might then reveal non-standard decoherence effects, in additionto standard ones (due to, e.g., finite source size and detector resolution.) Inthis work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in thepropagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactorexperiment KamLAND, which jointly provide us with the best available probes ofdecoherence at neutrino energies E ~ few MeV. In the solar neutrino case, bymeans of a perturbative approach, decoherence is shown to modify the standard(adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor. Byassuming a power-law dependence of decoherence effects in the energy domain(E^n with n = 0,+/-1,+/-2), theoretical predictions for two-family neutrinomixing are compared with the data and discussed. We find that neither solar norKamLAND data show evidence in favor of non-standard decoherence effects, whosecharacteristic parameter gamma_0 can thus be significantly constrained. In the\"Lorentz-invariant\" case n=-1, we obtain the upper limit gamma_0<0.78 x 10^-26GeV at 95% C.L. In the specific case n=-2, the constraints can also beinterpreted as bounds on possible matter density fluctuations in the Sun, whichwe improve by a factor of ~ 2 with respect to previous analyses.",

We concentrate on the Luminous BlueVariables, which display the greatest amount of polarimetric variability andfor which we recently conducted a spectropolarimetric survey. Our model resultsindicate that the observed level of polarimetric variability can be reproducedfor two regimes of parameter space: one of a small number of massive,optically-thick clumps; and one of a very large number of low-mass clumps.Although a systematic time-resolved monitoring campaign is required todistinguish between the two scenarios, we currently favour the latter, giventhe short timescale of the observed polarization variability. As thepolarization is predicted to scale linearly with mass-loss rate, we anticipatethat all hot stars with very large mass-loss rates should display polarimetricvariability.

The material contentconsists of two fluids: radiation and Chaplygin gas. The quantization of thesemodels is made by following the Wheeler and DeWitt's prescriptions. Using theSchutz formalism, the time notion is recovered and the Wheeler-DeWitt equationtransforms into a time dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, which rules thedynamics of the early universe, under the action of an effective potential$V_{ef}$. Using a finite differences method and the Crank-Nicholson scheme, ina code implemented in the program OCTAVE, we solve the corresponding timedependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation and obtain the time evolution of a initialwave packet. This wave packet satisfies appropriate boundary conditions. Thecalculation of the tunneling probabilities shows that the universe may emergefrom the Planck era to an inflationary phase. It also shows that, the tunnelingprobability is a function of the mean energy of the initial wave packet and oftwo parameters related to the Chaplygin gas. We also show a comparison betweenthese results and those obtained by the WKB approximation.",

Furthermore, the shape of the emission linepermits a direct determination of the disk size which is in good agreement withtheoretical estimates.

In detail, at all redshifts up to z=1: a)Haloes with M<M* tend to be more oblate when located in clusters than in theother environments; this trend is reversed at higher masses: above about M*,halos in clusters are typically more prolate than similar massive haloes insheets, filaments and voids. b) Haloes with M>M* in filaments spin more rapidlythan similar mass haloes in clusters; haloes in voids have the lowest medianspin parameters; c) Haloes with M<M* tend to be younger in voids and older inclusters; d) In sheets, halo spin vectors tend to lie within the sheet planeindependent of mass; in filaments, instead, haloes with M<M* tend to spinparallel to the filament and haloes with M>M* perpendicular to it. For massesM>M*, the major axis of haloes in filaments and sheets is strongly aligned withthe filament or the sheet. Such halo-LSS alignments may be of importance inweak lensing analyses of cosmic shear.

        "abstract": "The cycling operation is a special kind of conjugation that can be applied toelements in Artin's braid groups, in order to reduce their length. It is a keyingredient of the usual solutions to the conjugacy problem in braid groups. Intheir seminal paper on braid-cryptography, Ko, Lee et al. proposed the {\\itcycling problem} as a hard problem in braid groups that could be interestingfor cryptography. In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem,mainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffrewhich shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast. This resultalso holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.  On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usuallysolved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets(left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use rightnormal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy searchproblem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may thinkthat even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a smallright-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular caseof rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS ofa given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, theisomorphism being defined using iterated cycling. We conjecture that the sameis true for every element, not necessarily rigid, in braid groups andArtin-Tits groups of spherical type.",

We findthat fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. Exponentialdisks are well fit with Sersic models and have small measurement errors,whereas fits to de Vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to thelarge amount of light at large radii. We find that both codes provide reliablefits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness isabove that of the sky. Moreover, both codes return errors that significantlyunderestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated withsimulations. We find that GIM2D suffers significant systematic errors forspheroids with close companions owing to the difficulty of effectively maskingout neighboring galaxy light; there appears to be no work around to thisimportant systematic in GIM2D's current implementation. While this crowdingerror affects only a small fraction of galaxies in GEMS, it must be accountedfor in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fieldswith GIM2D. In contrast, GALFIT results are robust to the presence of neighborsbecause it can simultaneously fit the profiles of multiple companions therebydeblending their effect on the fit to the galaxy of interest. We find GALFIT'srobustness to nearby companions and factor of >~20 faster runtime speed areimportant advantages over GIM2D for analyzing large HST/ACS datasets.

We develop a numerical scheme that significantly improves theaccuracy and robustness of the solution in this regime. We use a modified formof the WENO method to construct a finite-volume general relativistichydrodynamics code called WHAM that converges at fifth order. We avoid (1)field-by-field decomposition by adaptively reducing down to 2-point stencilsnear discontinuities for a more accurate treatment of shocks, and (2) excessivereduction to low order stencils, as in the standard WENO formalism, bymaintaining high order accuracy in smooth monotonic flows.

These events are characterized bylong-period, nearly-radial orbits of compact objects around a central massiveblack hole. The gravitational radiation emitted during such events consists ofa short burst, corresponding to periapse passage, followed by a longer, silentinterval. In this paper we investigate the impact of including relativisticcorrections to the description of the compact object's trajectory via ageodesic treatment, as well as including higher-order multipole corrections inthe waveform calculation. The degree to which the relativistic corrections areimportant depends on the EMRB's orbital parameters. We find that relativisticEMRBs (v_{max}}/c > 0.25) are not rare and actually account for approximatelyhalf of the events in our astrophysical model. The relativistic correctionstend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to aNewtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked byparameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particularimportance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameterestimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive blackhole. Consequently, we postulate that if a relativistic EMRB is detected, suchdephasing might be used to probe the relativistic character of the massiveblack hole and obtain information about its spin.",

        "abstract": "The magnetic field in an accretion disk is estimated assuming that all of theangular momentum within prescribed accretion disk radii is removed by a jet.The magnetic field estimated at the base of the jet is extrapolated to theblazar emission region using a model for a relativistic axisymmetric jetcombined with some simplifying assumptions based on the relativistic nature ofthe flow. The extrapolated magnetic field is compared with estimates based uponthe synchrotron and inverse Compton emission from three blazars, MKN 501, MKN421 and PKS 2155-304. The magnetic fields evaluated from pure synchrotron self-Compton models are inconsistent with the magnetic fields extrapolated in thisway. However, in two cases inverse Compton models in which a substantial partof the soft photon field is generated locally agree well, mainly because thesemodels imply magnetic field strengths which are closer to being consistent withPoynting flux dominated jets. This comparison is based on estimating the massaccretion rate from the jet energy flux. Further comparisons along these lineswill be facilitated by independent estimates of the mass accretion rate inblazars and by more detailed models for jet propagation near the black hole.",

The model is calculatedself-consistently along with the ionization and thermal structure of thesurrounding nebula. The result is a complete line and continuum spectrum of theplasma. Here we focus on the ions of the He I sequence and reconsider thestandard helium-like X-ray diagnostics. We first consider semi-analyticalpredictions and compare these with previous work in the low-density,optically-thin limit. We then perform numerical calculations of helium-likeX-ray emission (such as is observed in some regions of Seyferts) and predictline ratios as a function of ionizing flux, hydrogen density, and columndensity. In particular, we demonstrate that, in photoionized plasmas, the$R$-ratio, a density indicator in a collisional plasma, depends on theionization fraction and is strongly affected by optical depth for large columndensities. We also introduce the notion that the $R$-ratio is a measure of theincident continuum at UV wavelengths. The $G$-ratio, which istemperature-sensitive in a collisional plasma, is also discussed, and shown tobe strongly affected by continuum pumping and optical depth as well.

In these cases, when most of the emission comes from the vicinity ofthe event horizon, the light curves become asymmetric at ingress and egress. Wenext investigate the atmospheric absorption and scattering effects of thecompanion stars. By using the solar-type atmospheric model, we have taken intoaccount the atmospheric effects of the companion star, such as thephotoionization by HI and HeI. We found that the eclipsing light curvesobserved at 1 keV possibly contain the information of the black hole spin.However, in our atmospheric model, the effects of the atmosphere are muchlarger than the effects of the black hole spin. Therefore, even in the casethat the light curves contain the information of the black hole spin, it may bedifficult to extract the information of the black hole spin if we do not havethe realistic atmospheric profiles, such as the temperature, and the numberdensities for several elements. Even in such cases, the light-curve asymmetriesdue to the rotation of the accretion disc exist.

It is assumed thatthe collapsing speeds of the two fluids are very large. We explore thiscondition by using the high-speed approximation scheme. There arise two cases,i.e., bounded and vanishing of the ratios of the pressures with densities oftwo fluids given by $c_s, d_s$. It is shown that the high-speed approximationscheme breaks down by non-zero pressures $p_1, p_2$ when $c_s, d_s$ are boundedbelow by some positive constants. The failure of the high-speed approximationscheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests theuncertainity on the evolution at and after this time. In the bounded case, thenaked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical twoperfect fluids. For the vanishing case, if a linear equation of state is used,the high-speed collapse does not break down by the effects of the pressures andconsequently a naked singularity forms.

In thelimit of a continuum of infinite layers, the optimal power distribution thatminimizes the expected distortion is given by the solution to a set of lineardifferential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. Inthe optimal power distribution, as SNR increases, the allocation over thehigher layers remains unchanged; rather the extra power is allocated towardsthe lower layers. On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses persource symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expecteddistortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expectedcapacity. While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at thetransmitter (CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization ofindependent fading paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversityexceeds that from CSIT, especially when b is large.",

        "abstract": "Massive stars, supernovae (SNe), and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)have a huge impact on their environment. Despite their importance, acomprehensive knowledge of which massive stars produce which SN/GRB is hithertolacking. We present a brief overview about our knowledge of mass loss in theHertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) covering evolutionary phases of the OB mainsequence, the unstable Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage, and the Wolf-Rayet(WR) phase. Despite the fact that metals produced by ``self-enrichment'' in WRatmospheres exceed the initial -- host galaxy -- metallicity, by orders ofmagnitude, a particularly strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on theinitial metallicity is found for WR stars at sub-solar metallicities (1/10 --1/100 solar). This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model forGRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angularmomentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR windsmay inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discussrecently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe2001ig and 2003bg. We show that both the sinusoidal behaviour and therecurrence timescale of these modulations are consistent with the predictedmass-loss behaviour of LBVs, and we suggest LBVs may be the progenitors of somecore-collapse SNe.",

        "abstract": "The favoured progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are rapidlyrotating Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. However, most Galactic WR stars are slowrotators, as stellar winds are thought to remove angular momentum. This poses achallenge to the collapsar model. Recent observations indicate that GRBs occurpredominately in low metallicity (Z) environments, which may resolve theproblem: lower Z leads to less mass loss, which may inhibit angular momentumremoval, allowing WR stars to remain rotating rapidly until collapse. We wishto determine whether low Z WR stars rotate on average more rapidly thanGalactic WR stars, and perform a Very Large Telescope (VLT) linearspectropolarimetry survey of WR stars in the low Z environment of the LargeMagellanic Cloud (LMC) and compare our results with the Galactic sample. Wefind that only 2 out of 13 (i.e. 15%) of LMC WR stars show line polarizationeffects, compared to a similarly low fraction of ~15-20% for Galactic WR stars.The low incidence of line polarization effects in LMC WR stars suggests thatthe threshold metallicity where significant differences in WR rotationalproperties occur is below that of the LMC (Z ~ 0.5 Zsun), possibly constrainingGRB progenitor channels to this upper metallicity.",

It turns out that thestructural properties of an alanine molecule in aqueous solution can differsignificantly from those in crystalline phase, these differences being mainlyattributed to hydrogen bonding interactions. In particular, we found that thelargest difference between the two alanine forms can be seen for theorientation and bond lengths of the carboxylate (COO-) group: in aqueoussolution the C-O bond lengths appear to strongly correlate with the number ofwater molecules which form hydrogen bonds with the COO- group. Furthermore, thehydrogen bond lengths are shorter and the hydrogen bond angles are larger forL-alanine in water as compared to crystal.

Themethod is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equationformalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method ina chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phaseand surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small numberof diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbondioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulationis started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but nosurface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flator rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, Oand CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under theconditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to asignificant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,the evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which inturn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surfacechemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermaldesorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assortedmolecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allowsdetermination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. Themantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide,carbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other thana slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreementwith observations.",

For rectangular loops the spin-stringinteraction vanishes and there is no spin-spin term in the resulting heavyquark potential.

The torque on an orbit exerted by thecluster depends on the eccentricity of the orbit.

Aims: To characterize the behaviour and hence the nature of the sourcethrough temporal and spectral IBIS analysis. Methods: Detailed spectral andtemporal analysis has been performed using standard INTEGRAL software OSAv.5.1. Results: To date, IGR J11321-5311 has been detected only once. It wasactive for about 3.5 hours, a short and bright flare lasting about 1.5 hours isevident in the IBIS light curve. It reached a peak flux of about 80 mCrab or2.2x10E-9 erg cmE-2 sE-1 (20--300 keV),corresponding to a peak luminosity of1.1x10E37 erg sE-1 (assuming a distance of 6.5 kpc).

We use the electric drift approximation,valid for low-density plasmas.  We linearise the coupled relativistic cold-fluid and Maxwell equations in theelectric drift approximation. The non-linear eigenvalue problem for theperturbed azimuthal electric field is solved numerically with standard technicsfor boundary value problems like the shooting method. The spectrum of therelativistic diocotron instability in a non-neutral plasma column confinedbetween two cylindrically conducting walls is computed.  For low-speed motions, we recover the eigenfunctions and eigenspectra of thenon-relativistic diocotron instability. Our algorithm is also checked in therelativistic planar diode geometry for which an analytical expression of thedispersion relation is known. As expected, when the relativistic andelectromagnetic effects become significant, the diocotron instability tends tostabilise. In cylindrical geometry, for some special rotation profile, allazimuthal modes $l$ are completely suppressed for sufficiently relativisticflows. However, for the profile relevant to the electrosphere, depending on theexact rotation curves, the growth rates can either significantly decrease tillthey vanish or persist for moderate $l$.",

        "abstract": "We obtained H-band polarimetric data of IRAS 19312+1950 using thenear-infrared camera (CIAO) on the 8 m Subaru telescope. In order toinvestigate the physical properties of the central star and the nebula, weperformed dust radiative transfer modeling and compared the model results withthe observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs), the radial profiles of thetotal intensity image, and the fraction of linear polarization map. The totalintensity image shows a nearly spherical core with ~3\" radius, an S-shaped armextending ~10\" in the northwest to southeast direction, and an extended lobetowards the southwest. The polarization map shows a centro-symmetric vectoralignment in almost the entire nebula and low polarizations along the S-shapedarm. These results suggest that the nebula is accompanied by a central star,and the S-shaped arm has a physically ring-like structure. From our radiativetransfer modeling, we estimated the stellar temperature, the bolometricluminosity, and the current mass-loss rate to be 2800 K, 7000 L_sun, and5.3x10^{-6} M_sun yr^{-1}, respectively. Taking into account previousobservational results, such as the detection of SiO maser emissions andsilicate absorption feature in the 10 $\\mu$m spectrum, our dust radiativetransfer analysis based on our NIR imaging polarimetry suggests that (1) thecentral star of IRAS 19312+1950 is likely to be an oxygen-rich, dust-enshroudedAGB star and (2) most of the circumstellar material originates from othersources (e.g. ambient dark clouds) rather than as a result of mass loss fromthe central star.",

The connection between the group parameter and the Hubbleconstant H0 is established.

This conclusion is confirmedvia a generalization of the standard Special Relativity clock synchronizationprocedure to the space expanding case. The obtained formulae are in accordancewith the observable Pioneer Anomaly effect. The anomalous blue-shifted drift isuniversal, does not depend on the presence of graviting centers and can be, inprinciple, observed on any frequencies under suitable experimental conditions.The explicit analytic expression for the speed of recession--intergalacticdistance ratio is obtained in the form of a function of the red shift z validin the whole range of its variation.

The long (120 ks) exposurewith chandra HETG allows a detailed study of the soft X-ray continuum and ofthe narrow component of the Fe Kalpha line. The rxte PCA data are used to putan upper limit on the broad line component and constrain the hard X-raycontinuum. A strong soft excess below 1 keV is observed in the time-averagedHETG spectrum, which can be parameterized with a steep power law or a thermalmodel. The flux variability at low energies indicates that the origin of thesoft excess cannot be entirely ascribed to the circumnuclear diffuse emission,detected by chandra on scales of 20-30 arcsec (22-33 kpc). A narrow (sigma<90eV) Fe Kalpha line (with EW< 100 eV) is observed by the chandra HEG. Similarvalues for the line parameters are measured by the rxte PCA, suggesting thatthe contribution from a broad line component is negligible. The fact that theexposure is split into two observations taken three days apart allows us toinvestigate the spectral and temporal evolution of the source on differenttimescales. Significant flux variability associated with spectral changes isobserved on timescales of hours and days. The spectral variability is similarto that observed in radio-quiet AGN ruling out a jet-dominated origin of theX-rays.",

We first corroborate previous per-event total particle yields inUpsilon(1S)->ggg compared with nearby continuum (e+e- -> qqbar) indicatinggreater (x2) per-event yields of baryons in 3-gluon fragmentation. We findsimilar results when we extend that comparison to include the Upsilon(2S) andUpsilon(3S) resonances. With higher statistics, we now also probe the momentumdependence of these per-event particle yields. Next, we compare particleproduction in the photon-tagged process Upsilon(1S)->gggamma with that in e+e--> qqbar events, to allow comparison of two-parton with three-partonparticle-specific fragmentation. For each particle, we determine the`enhancement' ratio, defined as the ratio of particle yields per gluonfragmentation event compared to quark fragmentation event. Thus defined, anenhancement of 1.0 implies equal per-event production in both gluon and quarkfragmentation. In the photon-tagged analysis (U(1S)->gggamma compared to e+e--> qqbar+gamma), we find almost no enhancement for protons (1.2+/-0.1), but asignificant enhancement (1.9+/-0.3) for /\\'s. Overall, per-event baryonproduction in radiative two-gluon fragmentation is somewhat smaller than thatobserved in three-gluon decays of the Upsilon(1S).

The 87 GHz continuum emission reveals twocontinuum peaks MM-1 and MM-2 along a molecular ridge.

For dust emissivity index $\\beta$ of 1.3, the masses in the dustpeaks amount to 70 \\msun for MM-1, and 27 \\msun for MM-2. Assuming internalheating, the central luminosities of MM-1 and MM-2 are $6 \\times 10^4$ and $8\\times 10^3$ \\lsun, respectively.  The SiO emission reveals a well collimated outflow emanating from MM-1. Thejet-like outflow is also detected in \\nh3 at velocities similar to the SiOemission.

Spectroscopicallymeasured radial velocities of ~450 emission knots within the remnant show twodistinct kinematic populations of optical knots: a high-velocity group withradial velocities in the range of 700 - 1100 km/s and a lower velocity groupexhibiting radial expansion velocities below ~250 km/s. We interpret thehigh-velocity knots as ejecta from the SN explosion and the low-velocity knotsas shocked circumstellar material likely resulting from pre-SN mass loss. Thechemical signatures of the two populations also show marked differences. Thehigh velocity group includes a substantial number of knots with notably higher[N II]/H-alpha ratios not seen in the lower velocity population, suggestinggreater nitrogen enrichment in the SN ejecta than in the CSM.

The gravitational field of the system isdominated by the black hole in its sphere of influence. It is further modifiedby the cluster mean field (a spherical term) and a gaseous disc/torus (anaxially symmetric term) causing a secular evolution of stellar orbits via Kozaioscillations. Intermittent phases of large eccentricity increase the chancethat stars become damaged inside the tidal radius of the central hole. Suchevents can produce debris and lead to recurring episodes of enhanced accretionactivity. We introduce an effective loss cone and associate it with tidaldisruptions during the high-eccentricity phases of the Kozai cycle. Bynumerical integration of the trajectories forming the boundary of the loss conewe determine its shape and volume. We also include the effect of relativisticadvance of pericentre. The potential of the disc has the efffect of enlargingthe loss cone and, therefore, the predicted number of tidally disrupted starsshould grow by factor of ~10^2. On the other hand, the effect of the clustermean potential together with the relativistic pericentre advance act againstthe eccentricity oscillations. In the end we expect the tidal disruption eventsto be approximately ten times more frequent in comparison with the model inwhich the three effects -- the cluster mean field, the relativistic pericentreadvance, and the Kozai mechanism -- are all ignored. The competition ofdifferent influences suppresses the predicted star disruption rate as the blackhole mass increases.

We show that mode-couplinggenerates additional oscillations that are out of phase with those in thelinear spectrum, leading to shifts in the scales of oscillation nodes definedwith respect to a smooth spectrum. When Fourier transformed, these out of phaseoscillations induce percent-level shifts in the acoustic peak of the two-pointcorrelation function. We present predictions for these shifts as a function ofredshift; these should be considered as a robust lower limit to the morerealistic case that includes in addition redshift distortions and galaxy bias.We show that these nonlinear effects occur at very large scales, leading to abreakdown of linear theory at scales much larger than commonly thought.

Often blogs link to one another, creating a publiclyavailable record of how information and influence spreads through an underlyingsocial network. Aggregating links from several blog posts creates a directedgraph which we analyze to discover the patterns of information propagation inblogspace, and thereby understand the underlying social network. Not only areblogs interesting on their own merit, but our analysis also sheds light on howrumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computer networks.  Here we report some surprising findings of the blog linking and informationpropagation structure, after we analyzed one of the largest available datasets,with 45,000 blogs and ~ 2.2 million blog-postings. Our analysis also shedslight on how rumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computernetworks. We also present a simple model that mimics the spread of informationon the blogosphere, and produces information cascades very similar to thosefound in real life.",

        "abstract": "It has been shown recently by Kapustin and Tomasiello that the mathematicalnotion of Hamiltonian actions on twisted generalized K\\\"ahler manifolds is inperfect agreement with the physical notion of general $(2,2)$ gauged sigmamodels with three-form fluxes. In this article, we study the twistedequivariant cohomology theory of Hamiltonian actions on $H$-twisted generalizedcomplex manifolds. If the manifold satisfies the$\\bar{\\partial}\\partial$-lemma, we establish the equivariant formality theorem.If in addition, the manifold satisfies the generalized K\\\"ahler condition, weprove the Kirwan injectivity in this setting. We then consider the Hamiltonianaction of a torus on an $H$-twisted generalized Calabi-Yau manifold and extendto this case the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem for the push-forward measure.  As a side result, we show in this paper that the generalized K\\\"ahlerquotient of a generalized K\\\"ahler vector space can never have a(cohomologically) non-trivial twisting.

The aim is to find the optimal rates at whichthe sources should be compressed and the network flows using which they shouldbe transmitted so that the cost of the transmission is minimal. We considernetworks with capacity constraints and linear cost functions. The problem iscomplicated by the fact that the description of the feasible rate region ofdistributed source coding problems typically has a number of constraints thatis exponential in the number of sources. This renders general purpose solversinefficient. We present a framework in which these problems can be solvedefficiently by exploiting the structure of the feasible rate regions coupledwith dual decomposition and optimization techniques such as the subgradientmethod and the proximal bundle method.",

However, the process of collaboration introducessignificant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the sameinformation. In this paper, a technique that significantly reduces thecollaboration overhead is proposed. It consists of two phases. In the firstphase, nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion. Collisions, when theyoccur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the secondphase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system andbeamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. Thisstep requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complexnumber, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and whichenables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination.The scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the networkcoordinates.

The energy of the fundamental harmonicof the cyclotron resonance absorption line near the maximum of the X-ray fluxfrom the source (luminosity range 5x10^{37} - 2x10^{38} erg/s) is ~11 keV. Whenthe pulsar luminosity falls below ~5x10^{37} erg/s, the energy of thefundamental harmonic is displaced sharply toward the high energies, up to ~16keV. Under the assumption of a dipole magnetic field configuration, this changein cyclotron harmonic energy corresponds to a decrease in the height of theemitting region by ~2 km, while other spectral parameters, in particular, thecutoff energy, remain essentially constant. At a luminosity ~7x10^{37} erg/s,four almost equidistant cyclotron line harmonics are clearly seen in thespectrum. This suggests that either the region where the emission originates iscompact or the emergent spectrum from different (in height) segments of theaccretion column is uniform. We have found significant pulse profile variationswith energy, luminosity, and time. In particular, we show that the profilevariations from pulse to pulse are not reduced to a simple modulation of theaccretion rate specified by external conditions.",

The 2MASS fractions are consistently higher thanthe SDSS fractions in every comparison, and the BALQSO fractions steadilyincrease with wavelength from the SDSS u to the 2MASS K_s bands. Furthermore,the i - K_s color distributions of BALQSOs and non-BALQSOs indicate thatBALQSOs are redder than non-BALQSOs, with a K-S test probability of 2e-12.These results are consistent with the spectral difference between BALQSOs andnon-BALQSOs including both the absorption troughs and dust extinction inBALQSOs, which leads to significant selection biases against BALQSOs in theoptical bands. Using a simple simulation incorporating the luminosity functionof quasars and the amount of obscuration for BALQSOs, we simultaneously fit theBALQSO fractions in the SDSS and 2MASS bands.

Consider now a mechanical system, whose configuration space is a Lie groupand whose Lagrangian is invariant to left translations on that group, andassume that the mass geometry of the system may change under the action ofinternal control forces. Such system can also be reduced to the Lie group. Withno controls, this mechanical system describes a geodesic flow of theleft-invariant metric, given by the Lagrangian, and thus its reduced flow is astationary ideal fluid flow on the Lie group. The standard control problem forsuch system is to find the conditions, under which the system can be broughtfrom any initial position in the configuration space to another preassignedposition by changing its mass geometry. We show that under these conditions, bychanging the mass geometry, one can also bring one vortex manifold to any otherpreassigned vortex manifold.",

For small disorders we develop aperturbative technique which enables us to compute explicitly the averagedtemperature (energy) of the pinning transition. For strong disorder we computethe transition point both numerically and using the renormalization groupapproach. Our consideration is based on the following idea: the randompotential can be viewed as a periodic potential with the period $n$ in thelimit $n\\to\\infty$. The advantage of our approach stems from the ability tointegrate exactly over all spatial degrees of freedoms in the model and toreduce the initial problem to the analysis of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ofsome special non-Hermitian random matrix with disorder--dependent diagonal andconstant off-diagonal coefficients.

We find that the signalis robust against variations in methods of analysis, and is based onfluctuations in the Paleozoic and a substantial part of the Mesozoic.Examination of origination and extinction is somewhat ambiguous, with resultsdepending upon procedure. Origination and extinction intensity as defined by RMmay be affected by an artifact at 27 Myr in the duration of stratigraphicintervals. Nevertheless, when a procedure free of this artifact is implemented,the 27 Myr periodicity appears in origination, suggesting that the artifact mayultimately be based on a signal in the data. A 62 Myr feature appears inextinction, when this same procedure is used. We conclude that evidence for aperiodicity at 62 Myr is robust, and evidence for periodicity at approximately27 Myr is also present, albeit more ambiguous.",

Previously it was not even known if computing the valueexactly is NP-hard. We also describe a mathematical conjecture, which, if true,would imply hardness of approximation to within a constant.  We start our proof by describing two ways to modify classical multi-provergames to make them resistant to entangled provers. We then show that a strategyfor the modified game that uses entanglement can be ``rounded'' to one thatdoes not. The results then follow from classical inapproximability bounds. Ourwork implies that, unless P=NP, the values of entangled-prover games cannot becomputed by semidefinite programs that are polynomial in the size of theverifier's system, a method that has been successful for more restrictedquantum games.",

That theorypromised a \"general\" and \"homogeneous\" treatment of numerous questions arisingin various 19th-century theoretical contexts, and it hinged on two theorems,stated independently by Jordan and Weierstrass, that would today be consideredequivalent. It was, however, the perceived difference between those twotheorems that sparked the 1874 controversy. Focusing on this quarrel allows usto explore the algebraic identity of the polynomial practices of themanipulations of forms in use before the advent of structural approaches tolinear algebra. The latter approaches identified these practices with methodsfor the classification of similar matrices. We show that the prac- tices --Jordan's canonical reduction and Kronecker's invariant computation -- reflectidentities inseparable from the social context of the time. Moreover, thesepractices reveal not only tacit knowledge, local ways of thinking, but also --in light of a long history tracing back to the work of Lagrange, Laplace, Cau-chy, and Hermite -- two internal philosophies regarding the significance ofgenerality which are inseparable from two disciplinary ideals opposing algebraand arithmetic. By interrogating the cultural identities of such practices,this study aims at a deeper understanding of the history of linear algebrawithout focusing on issues related to the origins of theories or structures.",

        "abstract": "We have carried out a survey toward the central regions of 85 starless coresin HCN J = 1-0 to study inward motions in the cores. Sixty-four cores weredetected with HCN lines. The infall asymmetry in the HCN spectra is found to bemore prevalent, and more prominent than in any other previously used infalltracers such as CS J = 2-1, DCO+ J = 2-1, and N2H+ J = 1-0. We found closerelation between the intensities of the HCN and N2H+ lines. This implies thatthe HCN is not much depleted in the central regions of the cores. In somecores, the HCN spectra show different sign of asymmetry from other molecularlines. A few cores show various signs of asymmetry in individual HCN hyperfinelines. The distribution of the velocity shift dV of the HCN profiles withrespect to the systemic velocity of the optically thin tracer is found to bemore shifted toward bluer side than those of other infall tracers, indicatingthat the HCN traces inward motions more frequently. The dV distribution of eachHCN hyperfine line for all sources is similar. Moreover the dV values obtainedfrom different HCN hyperfine lines for each source are nearly similar. Thesemay mean that most of starless cores are in similar kinematic states across thelayers of the cores. We identify 17 infall candidates using all availableindicators such as the velocity shift dV and the blue to red peak intensityratio of double peaked profiles for HCN J = 1-0, CS J = 2-1, J = 3-2, DCO+ J =2-1, and N2H+ J = 1-0. Four of them, L63, L492, L694-2, and L1197 are found toshow higher blue to red ratio in the HCN hyperfine line along the loweropacity, suggesting that infall speed becomes higher toward the center.",

The scaling behavior isconfirmed numerically by performing a finite size scaling analysis for systemsof different sizes, consistent with the conformal invariance at the criticalpoint.

The complete set of observations iscentered on the association NGC 346 and contains almost 100,000 stars down to V~28 mag. In this study we focus on the northern part of the region, whichcovers almost the whole stellar content of BS 90. We construct its stellarsurface density profile and derive structural parameters. Isochrone fits on theCMD of the cluster results in an age of about 4.5 Gyr. The luminosity functionis constructed and the present-day mass function of BS 90 has been obtainedusing the mass-luminosity relation, derived from the isochrone models. We founda slope between -1.30 and -0.95, comparable or somewhat shallower than atypical Salpeter IMF. Examination of the radial dependence of the mass functionshows a steeper slope at larger radial distances, indicating mass segregationin the cluster. The derived half-mass relaxation time of 0.95 Gyr suggests thatthe cluster is mass segregated due to its dynamical evolution. From theisochrone model fits we derive a metallicity for BS 90 of [Fe/H]=-0.72, whichadds an important point to the age-metallicity relation of the SMC.

The transmission shows weak dependence on frequency for thelattice wave with a fixed angle of incidence.

A criticalangle of incidence exists when the phonon is incident from the side with largegroup velocities to the side with low ones. No significant mode conversion isobserved among different acoustic wave branches at the interface, except whenthe incident angle is near the critical value.

Investigations of the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalueproblem associated with such Hamiltonians have shown that in many cases theentire energy spectrum is real and positive and that the eigenfunctions form anorthogonal and complete basis. Furthermore, the quantum theories determined bysuch Hamiltonians have been shown to be consistent in the sense that theprobabilities are positive and the dynamical trajectories are unitary. However,the geometrical structures that underlie quantum theories formulated in termsof such Hamiltonians have hitherto not been fully understood. This paperstudies in detail the geometric properties of a Hilbert space endowed with aparity structure and analyses the characteristics of a PT-symmetric Hamiltonianand its eigenstates. A canonical relationship between a PT-symmetric operatorand a Hermitian operator is established. It is shown that the quadratic formcorresponding to the parity operator, in particular, gives rise to a naturalpartition of the Hilbert space into two halves corresponding to states havingpositive and negative PT norm. The indefiniteness of the norm can becircumvented by introducing a symmetry operator C that defines a positivedefinite inner product by means of a CPT conjugation operation.",

        "abstract": "(abridged) The soft excess seen in the X-ray spectra of many high massaccretion rate AGN can be well modelled by reflection from a partially ionisedaccretion disc. However, the derived parameters are often extreme, both interms of the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and these modelsrequire that the disc is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative modeluses similarly partially ionised, velocity smeared material but seen inabsorption, though again the derived velocities are extreme, requiring magneticdriving (in the jet?) rather than a simple line driven disc wind. We find thatwhile both models give comparably good fits to XMM--Newton data, we favour theabsorption model as, unlike reflection, all the derived spectral indices aresoft. This is as expected by analogy with the correspondingly high massaccretion rate stellar mass black holes. Furthermore, these X-ray spectra areconsistent with a one--to--one mapping between AGN type and spectral state,with NLS1's having softer spectra corresponding to the very high state, whilethe broad line AGN have Gamma~2 as expected for the high/soft state. We alsouse the simultaneous OM data to derive the ratio of disc to total accretionpower which is another tracer of spectral state in X-ray binaries. This doesnot always show that the disc in NLS1's contributes less than 80 per cent ofthe total power, as expected for a very high state. We suggest that this is anartifact of the standard disc models used to determine the disc luminosity inour fits. The disc seen in the very high state of black hole binaries is oftenobserved to be distorted from the standard shape, and a similar effect inNLS1's could recover the correspondance between black hole binary spectralstate and AGN type.",

The X-ray spectra are consistent with heavily absorbed power laws(21.8 < log NH < 23.4), and all of them appear to be absorbed AGN.

Thisimplies that ratios of X-ray absorption to optical/UV extinction equivalent to> 100 times the Galactic gas-to-dust ratio are rare in AGN absorbers (at most afew percent of the population), and may be restricted to broad absorption-lineQSOs. Seven objects appear to have an additional soft X-ray component inaddition to the heavily absorbed power law. We consider the implications of ourresults in the light of the AGN unified scheme.

The scalar-tensor theory is widely discussed and used in tests ofrelativistic gravity, especially after the interests in inflation, cosmologicalconstant and dark energy in cosmology. In the Lagrangian, intermediate-rangegravity term has a similar form as cosmological term. Here we present the fullsecond post-Newtonian approximation of the scalar-tensor theory includingviable examples of intermediate-range gravity.

In the present work we study the possibility of an earliermetal enrichment of the photospheres by means of impacting planetesimals duringthe first 20-30Myr. Here we explore this contamination process by simulatingthe interactions of an inward migrating planet with a disc of planetesimalinterior to its orbit. The results show the percentage of planetesimals thatfall on the star. We identified the dependence of the planet's eccentricity($e_p$) and time scale of migration ($\\tau$) on the rate of infallingplanetesimals. For very fast migrations ($\\tau=10^2$yr and $\\tau=10^3$yr) thereis no capture in mean motion resonances, independently of the value of $e_p$.Then, due to the planet's migration the planetesimals suffer close approacheswith the planet and more than 80% of them are ejected from the system. For slowmigrations ($\\tau=10^5$yr and $\\tau=10^6$yr) the percentage of collisions withthe planet decrease with the increase of the planet's eccentricity. For $e_p=0$and $e_p=0.1$ most of the planetesimals were captured in the 2:1 resonance andmore than 65% of them collided with the star. Whereas migration of a Jupitermass planet to very short pericentric distances requires unrealistic high discmasses, these requirements are much smaller for smaller migrating planets. Oursimulations for a slowly migrating 0.1 $M_{\\rm Jupiter}$ planet, even demandinga possible primitive disc three times more massive than a primitive solarnebula, produces maximum [Fe/H] enrichments of the order of 0.18 dex.

It is shown that, if the zero point energies forthe cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that isnot cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,their separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numericaldifference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zeropoint value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the twozero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known smalldark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating tointerpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and aninterpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum arediscussed. In the first appendix to this paper, problems associated with thestandard model of cosmology are solved by redefining temperature in the dustuniverse model.

Heavy-jet spectra can then be calculated in the masslessapproximation, which is simpler than a massive calculation and reduces thetheoretical uncertainties by a factor of three.

        "abstract": "By 2D hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state andneutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radialhydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretionphase of collapsing stellar cores. The convective mode of instability, which isdriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by timevariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the developmentof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in thepostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth ofsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shockedflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growthof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shockinstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can triggerconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of theaverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamicinstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through theneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition insupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting andmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because theaccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of theSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and avariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for theadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by theaccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close anamplifying global feedback loop.

The most likelycandidate mechanism is the attractor network, and a great deal of effort hasgone toward investigating it theoretically. Yet, despite almost a quartercentury of intense work, attractor networks are not fully understood. Inparticular, there are still two unanswered questions. First, how is it thatattractor networks exhibit irregular firing, as is observed experimentallyduring working memory tasks? And second, how many memories can be stored underbiologically realistic conditions? Here we answer both questions by studying anattractor neural network in which inhibition and excitation balance each other.Using mean field analysis, we derive a three-variable description of attractornetworks. From this description it follows that irregular firing can exist onlyif the number of neurons involved in a memory is large. The same mean fieldanalysis also shows that the number of memories that can be stored in a networkscales with the number of excitatory connections, a result that has beensuggested for simple models but never shown for realistic ones.

Firstly, we describe fluctuations in the occupation numbers of the energylevels for an isolated system, using previously unknown identities that we havederived for the purpose, which allow us to calculate the moments of theoccupation numbers. Then we compute analytically the probability distributionof these fluctuations. We show that, for every system of fixed and finite $N$,fluctuations about the equilibrium distribution do, in fact, depend on thetemperature. Indeed, at higher temperatures the fluctuations can be so largethat the system does not fully converge on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distributionbut actually fluctuates around it. We term this state, where not one macrostatebut a region of macrostates closely fit the underlying distribution, a ``{\\itfluctuating equilibrium}''.

Keplerian rotation for the disk velocitygradient of 5 kms-1 requires a 9 M_sun central star, which cannot explain thetotal luminosity observed in the region. This may indicate that the disk doesnot rotate with a Keplerian law due to the extreme youth of this object. Ourhigh sensitivity radiocontinuum image at 7 mm shows in addition to the ionizedjet, an extended emission to the west (and marginally to the south) of the HW2jet, filling the south-west cavity of the HW2 disk. From the morphology andlocation of this free-free continuum emission at centimeter and millimeterwavelengths (spectral index of 0.4-1.5), we propose that the disk isphotoevaporating due to the UV radiation from the central star.

We use the Toulouse limit to exactly calculate the adiabatically pumpedspin current in the Kondo regime. In the absence of both potential scatteringand a voltage bias, the instantaneous charge current is strictly zero for ageneric Kondo model. However, a nonzero spin current can be pumped through thesystem in the presence of a finite magnetic field, provided the spin couplesasymmetrically to the two leads.

This approachallows us to describe both non-observation of the Theta+ in current nullexperiments and peculiar features of its production in positive experiments.Further, we are able to propose new experiments that might be decisive for theproblem of the Theta+ existence. Distributions of the Theta+ in suchexperiments can give important information both on higher Fock components ofconventional hadrons and about structure and hadronization properties of hadronremnants produced in hard processes. We also explain that description ofmultiquark hadrons may require a modified form of the constituent quark model,with quark masses and couplings being intermediate between their values for thefamiliar constituent quarks and the current ones.",

We show thatwhen the number of spins is sufficiently large both the density of sites andthe strength of the interaction between consecutive spins follow the Gaussianlaw. We develop an extension of the standard freezing trick argument thatenables us to exactly compute a certain number of eigenvalues and theircorresponding eigenfunctions. The eigenvalues thus computed are all integers,and in fact our numerical studies evidence that these are the only integereigenvalues of the chain under consideration. This fact suggests that thischain can be regarded as a finite-dimensional analog of the class ofquasi-exactly solvable Schroedinger operators, which has been extensivelystudied in the last two decades. We have applied the method of moments to studysome statistical properties of the chain's spectrum, showing in particular thatthe density of eigenvalues follows a Wigner-like law. Finally, we emphasizethat, unlike the original freezing trick, the extension thereof developed inthis paper can be applied to spin chains whose associated dynamical spin modelis only quasi-exactly solvable.",

The 2-10 keV continuum is described by a heavily absorbed (Nh~ 1e22 -1e23 cm-2) power law with photon index Gamma ~1.4, and strong (R~2) coldreflection. A narrow, unresolved Fe Kalpha emission line is detected,confirming previous findings, with EW 120eV. A soft excess is present below 2keV over the extrapolation of the hard X-ray power law, which we model with apower law with the same photon index as the hard power law, absorbed by acolumn density Nh=6e20 cm-2 in excess to Galactic. A host of emission lines arepresent below 2 keV, confirming previous indications from ASCA, due to H- andHe-like O, Mg, and Si. We attribute the origin of the lines to a photoionizedgas, with properties very similar to radio-quiet obscured AGN. Two differentionized media, or a single stratified medium, are required to fit the softX-ray data satisfactorily.

These are attached to the disclinations or areakin to Nye's dislocation densities, well suited here. The notion of 'extendedVolterra process' takes these relaxation processes into account and coversdifferent situations where this interplay takes place. These concepts areillustrated by applications in amorphous solids, mesomorphic phases andfrustrated media in their curved habit space.

For example, aone Solar-mass (M_Sun) star would be pulled by roughly 1 mas by a oneJupiter-mass (M_J) planet with a period of one-hundred years at a distance of20 pc. Such position accuracies can now be obtained with both ground-based andspace-based telescopes. The difficulty was that it often takes many decadesbefore a detectable position shift will occur. However, by the time the nextgeneration of astrometric missions such as SIM will be taking data, severaldecades will have past since the first astrometric mission, HIPPARCOS. Here wepropose to use a new astrometric method that employs a future, highly accurateSIM Quick-Look survey and HIPPARCOS data taken twenty years prior. Usingposition errors for SIM of 4 muas, this method enables the detection andcharacterization of Solar-system analogs (SOSAs) with periods up to 240 (500)years for 1 (10) M_J companions. Because many tens of thousands nearby starscan be surveyed this way for a modest expenditure of SIM time and SOSAs may bequite abundant, we expect to find many hundreds of extra-solar planets withlong-period orbits. Such a data set would nicely complement the short-periodsystems found by the radial-velocity method. Brown dwarfs and low-mass stellarcompanions can be found and characterized if their periods are shorter thanabout 500 years. This data set will provide invaluable constraints on models ofplanet formation, as well as a database for systems where the location of thegiant planets allow for the formation of low-mass planets in the habitablezone.

This technique, calledgyrochronology, permits the derivation of ages for solar- and late-type mainsequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique isclarified and developed here, and used to derive ages for illustrative groupsof nearby, late-type field stars with measured rotation periods. We firstdemonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of therotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the techniquepossible, and extends it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying themass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannotcurrently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. Theerrors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period.Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15%(plus possible systematic errors) for late-F, G, K, & early-M stars. Agesderived via gyrochronology for the Mt. Wilson stars are shown to be in goodagreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probablysuperior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the active main sequencefield stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators where other ages are notavailable. These are shown to be mostly younger than 1Gyr, with a median age of365Myr. The sample of single, late-type main sequence field stars assembled byPizzolato and collaborators is then assessed, and shown to have gyro agesranging from under 100Myr to several Gyr, and a median age of 1.2Gyr.

This frequency band offers unprecedented sensitivity (~25 mJy/beam)and resolution (~25 arcsec) for low-frequency observations. We review thehardware, the calibration and imaging strategies, comparing them to those athigher frequencies, including aspects of interference excision and wide-fieldimaging. Ionospheric phase fluctuations pose the major difficulty incalibrating the array. Over restricted fields of view or at times of extremelyquiescent ionospheric ``weather'', an angle-invariant calibration strategy canbe used. In this approach a single phase correction is devised for eachantenna, typically via self-calibration. Over larger fields of view or at timesof more normal ionospheric ``weather'' when the ionospheric isoplanatic patchsize is smaller than the field of view, we adopt a field-based strategy inwhich the phase correction depends upon location within the field of view. Thissecond calibration strategy was implemented by modeling the ionosphere abovethe array using Zernike polynomials. Images of 3C sources of moderate strengthare provided as examples of routine, angle-invariant calibration and imaging.Flux density measurements indicate that the 74 MHz flux scale at the VLA isstable to a few percent, and tied to the Baars et al. value of Cygnus A at the5 percent level. We also present an example of a wide-field image, devoid ofbright objects and containing hundreds of weaker sources, constructed from thefield-based calibration. We close with a summary of lessons the 74 MHz systemoffers as a model for new and developing low-frequency telescopes. (Abridged)",

The purpose of this book is toobtain a similar relationship for functors on a category of algebras over anoperad.

Applicationsto real life situations in which two-sided changes can occur are discussed.Traditionally, 2-CUSUM stopping rules have been used for this problem due totheir asymptotically optimal character as the mean time between false alarmstends to $\\infty$. In particular, attention has focused on 2-CUSUM harmonicmean rules due to the simplicity in calculating their first moments. In thispaper, we derive closed-form expressions for the first moment of a general2-CUSUM stopping rule. We use these expressions to obtain explicit upper andlower bounds for it. Moreover, we derive an expression for the rate of changeof this first moment as one of the threshold parameters changes. Based on theseexpressions we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds to this rate of change.Using these expressions we are able to find the best 2-CUSUM stopping rule withrespect to the extended Lorden criterion. In fact, we demonstrate not only theexistence but also the uniqueness of the best 2-CUSUM stopping both in the caseof a symmetric change and in the case of a non-symmetric case. Furthermore, wediscuss the existence of a modification of the 2-CUSUM stopping rule that has astrictly better performance than its classical 2-CUSUM counterpart for smallvalues of the mean time between false alarms.

The width process of a splitting tree is then a binary, homogeneousCrump--Mode--Jagers (CMJ) process, and is not Markovian unless the lifetimedistribution is exponential. Here, we allow the birth rate to be infinite, thatis, pairs of birth times and lifespans of newborns form a Poisson point processalong the lifetime of their mother, with possibly infinite intensity measure. Asplitting tree is a random (so-called) chronological tree. Each element of achronological tree is a (so-called) existence point $(v,\\tau)$ of someindividual $v$ (vertex) in a discrete tree, where $\\tau$ is a nonnegative realnumber called chronological level (time). We introduce a total order onexistence points, called linear order, and a mapping $\\varphi$ from the treeinto the real line which preserves this order. The inverse of $\\varphi$ iscalled the exploration process, and the projection of this inverse onchronological levels the contour process. For splitting trees truncated up tolevel $\\tau$, we prove that thus defined contour process is a L\\'evy processreflected below $\\tau$ and killed upon hitting 0.

        "abstract": "(Abridged) Using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in combination withanalytic modeling, we show that the galaxy stellar mass-metallicity relation(MZR) provides strong constraints on galactic outflows across cosmic time. Wecompare three outflow models: No outflows, a \"constant wind\" (cw) model thatemulates the popular Dekel & Silk (1986) scenario, and a ``momentum-drivenwind\" (vzw) model. We find that only the vzw scaling reproduces the observedz~2 MZR's slope, amplitude, and scatter. Comparing our fully three-dimensionalsimulations with a simple one-zone chemical evolution model, we find that theMZR can be understood in terms of three parameters: (1) The equilibriummetallicity Z_eq=y*SFR/ACC (where y=true yield), reflecting the enrichmentbalance between star formation rate SFR and gas accretion rate ACC; (2) thedilution time t_d=M_g/ACC, representing the timescale for a galaxy to return toZ_eq after a metallicity-perturbing interaction; and (3) the blowout massM_blowout, which is the galaxy stellar mass above which winds can escape itshalo. When outflows with mass loading factor MLF are present, galaxies belowM_blowout obey Z_eq = y/(1+MLF), while above M_blowout, Z_eq->y. Our cw modelhas M_blowout ~ 10^10 M_sun, which yields a sharp upturn in the MZR above thisscale and a flat MZR with large scatter below it, in strong disagreement withobservations. Our vzw model reproduces the observed Z_g \\propto M_*^0.3 becauseZ_eq \\propto MLF^-1 \\propto M_*^1/3 when MLF >> 1 (i.e. at low masses). Theflattening of the MZR at M_* > 10^10.5 M_sun observed by Tremonti et al.

Wepost-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model ofradiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusionspreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that theCNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due tothe lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transportincrease the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contactwith the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O atthe interface.

Enhanced molecular contentat the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helpsexciting transitions of intermediate energy. The relative molecular yield arefound higher for bigger clouds. Conclusions. Turbulent diffusion can be thesource of additional molecular production and should be included in chemicalmodels of the interstellar medium (ISM). It also is a good candidate for theinterpretation of observational problems such as warm H$_2$, CH$^+$ formationand presence of H$_3^+$.",

        "abstract": "We develop here a mechanism that, without making use of a cosmologicalconstant, reproduces an accelerating universe. This is done by taking intoaccount Casimir vacuum energy density, assuming that the underlying theoryallows a maximum momentum, that turns out to be the leading contribution termto Einstein equations in a large expanding FRW universe. As stated in numerousquantum gravity studies, we postulate that maximum momentum is related to theexistence of the Planck length as a fundamental length. This insight, togetherwith the assumption of a Planck scale correction to the energy/momentumdispersion-relation on a FRW background, is used here to calculate Casimirvacuum energy. We show that, under these hypothesis, an accelerated universeexpansion is obtained. As last step we analyze the compatibility of theresulting model with experimental data, writing down the equation of state forCasimir energy and pressure and observing that this equation of state belongsto a class of models that naturally fits cosmological observations. Weemphasize that our result relies, once a fundamental length is introduced inCasimir effect, just on general arguments thus it is independent on an explicitform of the energy-momentum dispersion relation.",

The basic steady state of this system, as described by granularhydrodynamic equations, involves a denser and colder layer of granulate locatedat the wall opposite to the driving wall.

        "abstract": "In this paper, the stability condition for low-density parity-check (LDPC)codes on the binary erasure channel (BEC) is extended to generalized LDPC(GLDPC) codes and doublygeneralized LDPC (D-GLDPC) codes. It is proved that, inboth cases, the stability condition only involves the component codes withminimum distance 2. The stability condition for GLDPC codes is always expressedas an upper bound to the decoding threshold. This is not possible for D-GLDPCcodes, unless all the generalized variable nodes have minimum distance at least3. Furthermore, a condition called derivative matching is defined in the paper.This condition is sufficient for a GLDPC or DGLDPC code to achieve thestability condition with equality. If this condition is satisfied, thethreshold of D-GLDPC codes (whose generalized variable nodes have all minimumdistance at least 3) and GLDPC codes can be expressed in closed form.",

Thedistributions in the color-color diagrams are fit well with single slopes toextinction levels of A_K ~ 7 (A_V ~ 59 mag). Consequently, there appears to beno significant variation of the extinction law with depth through the B59 lineof sight. However, when slopes are translated into the relative extinctioncoefficients A_\\lambda/A_K, we find an extinction law which departs from thesimple extrapolation of the near-infrared power law extinction curve, andagrees more closely with a dust extinction model for a cloud with a total toselective absorption R_V=5.5 and a grain size distribution favoring largergrains than those in the diffuse ISM. Thus, the difference we observe could bepossibly due to the effect of grain growth in denser regions. Finally, theslopes in our diagrams are somewhat less steep than those from the study ofIndebetouw et al.

Polchinski concerning theperturbative renormalization with flow equations. In the first part of thiswork, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and thenextended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is donefor a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions forsome of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains astatement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below theUV cutoff. In particular, nonrenormalizable theories can be treated withoutproblems in the proposed framework. In the second part, the standard covariantBRS quantization program for Euclidean Einstein gravity is applied. A momentumcutoff regularization is imposed and the resulting violation of theSlavnov-Taylor identities is discussed. Deriving Polchinski's renormalizationgroup equation for Euclidean quantum gravity, the predictivity of effectivequantum gravity at scales far below the Planck scale is investigated with flowequations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Tayloridentities is proposed and it is argued that in the effective quantum gravitycontext, the restoration will only be accomplished with finite accuracy.Finally, the no-cutoff limit of Euclidean quantum gravity is analyzed from theviewpoint of the Polchinski method.

ECHO is aimed atproviding a shock-capturing conservative method able to work at an arbitrarylevel of formal accuracy (for smooth flows), where the other existing GRMHD andGRMD schemes yield an overall second order at most. Moreover, our goal is topresent a general framework, based on the 3+1 Eulerian formalism, allowing fordifferent sets of equations, different algorithms, and working in a genericspace-time metric, so that ECHO may be easily coupled to any solver forEinstein's equations. Various high order reconstruction methods are implementedand a two-wave approximate Riemann solver is used. The induction equation istreated by adopting the Upwind Constrained Transport (UCT) procedures,appropriate to preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field inshock-capturing methods. The limiting case of magnetodynamics (also known asforce-free degenerate electrodynamics) is implemented by simply replacing thefluid velocity with the electromagnetic drift velocity and by neglecting thematter contribution to the stress tensor. ECHO is particularly accurate,efficient, versatile, and robust. It has been tested against severalastrophysical applications, including a novel test on the propagation of largeamplitude circularly polarized Alfven waves. In particular, we show thatreconstruction based on a Monotonicity Preserving filter applied to a fixed5-point stencil gives highly accurate results for smooth solutions, both inflat and curved metric (up to the nominal fifth order), while at the same timeproviding sharp profiles in tests involving discontinuities.",

Applying the samecriteria established in an earlier work, we find that, similar to IR QSOs atlow redshift, the far-infrared emission of these (sub)mm-loud QSOs mainlyoriginates from dust heated by starbursts. By combining low-z IR QSOs andhigh-z (sub)mm-loud QSOs, we find a trend that the star formation rate($\\Mstardot$) increases with the accretion rate ($\\Mdot$). We compare thevalues of $\\Mstardot/\\Mdot$ for submm emitting galaxies (SMGs), far-infraredultraluminous/hyperluminous QSOs and typical QSOs, and construct a likelyevolution scenario for these objects. The (sub)mm-loud QSO transition phase hasboth high $\\Mdot$ and $\\Mstardot$ and hence is important for establishing thecorrelation between the masses of black holes and spheroids.",

        "abstract": "CO observations have been so far the best way to trace molecular gas inexternal galaxies, but at low metallicity the gas mass deduced could be largelyunderestimated. At present, the kinematic information of CO data cubes are usedto estimate virial masses and trace the total mass of the molecular clouds.Millimeter dust emission can also be used as a dense gas tracer and couldunveil H2 envelopes lacking CO. These different tracers must be compared indifferent environments. This study compares virial masses to masses deducedfrom millimeter emission, in two GMC samples: the local molecular clouds in ourGalaxy and their equivalents in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of thenearest low metallicity dwarf galaxy. In our Galaxy, mass estimates deducedfrom millimeter emission are consistent with masses deduced from gamma rayanalysis and trace the total mass of the clouds. Virial masses aresystematically larger (twice on average) than mass estimates from millimeterdust emission. This difference decreases toward high masses and has alreadybeen reported in previous studies. In the SMC however, molecular cloud massesdeduced from SIMBA millimeter observations are systematically higher (twice onaverage for conservative values of the dust to gas ratio and dust emissivity)than the virial masses from SEST CO observations. The observed excess can notbe accounted for by any plausible change of dust properties. Taking a generalform for the virial theorem, we show that a magnetic field strength of ~15micro Gauss in SMC clouds could provide additional support to the clouds andexplain the difference observed. Masses of SMC molecular clouds have thereforebeen underestimated so far. Magnetic pressure may contribute significantly totheir support.",

Here we asked if the processing of the beta-dystroglycan couldinfluence the anchorage of Dp116 or/and utrophin in normal and mdx Schwann cellmembrane. We showed that MMP-9 was more activated in mdx nerve than inwild-type one.

Our targets are 74 F-M dwarfs in the youngstellar associations Eta Cha, TW Hydrae, Beta Pic, and Tuc-Hor, spanning agesfrom 6 to 30 Myr. While the Halpha EW for most F and G stars are consistentwith pure photospheric absorption, most K and M stars show chromosphericemission. By comparing Halpha EW in our sample to results in the literature, wesee a clear evolutionary sequence: Chromospheric activity declines steadilyfrom the T Tauri phase to the main sequence. Using activity as an ageindicator, we find a plausible age range for the Tuc-Hor association of 10-40Myr. Between 5 and 30 Myr, we do not see evidence for rotational braking in thetotal sample, thus angular momentum is conserved, in contrast to younger stars.This difference indicates a change in the rotational regulation at 5-10 Myr,possibly because disk braking cannot operate longer than typical disklifetimes, allowing the objects to spin up. The rotation-activity relation isflat in our sample; in contrast to main-sequence stars, there is no linearcorrelation for slow rotators. We argue that this is because young starsgenerate their magnetic fields in a fundamentally different way frommain-sequence stars, and not just the result of a saturated solar-type dynamo.By comparing our rotational velocities with published rotation periods for asubset of stars, we determine ages of 13 (7-20) Myr and 9 (7-17} Myr for theEta Cha and TWA associations, respectively, consistent with previous estimates.Thus we conclude that stellar radii from evolutionary models by Baraffe et al.(1998) are in agreement with the observed radii within +-15%.

We re-examine the constraints onthis scenario from the presently available cosmological data and investigatethe sensitivity expected from the Planck satellite.

Our observations are centered on the Coma Cluster ofgalaxies in the ``Great Wall'' of galaxies near the North Galactic Pole. Thecomplementary nature of these two instruments enables us to produce adistortion-free image that is sensitive to radiation on scales from 8$\\degr$down to that of an individual galaxy halo at the 100 Mpc distance of the GreatWall. Newly revealed patches of distributed radio ``glow'' are seen well abovethe detection limit. One prominent such area coincides with groupings of radiogalaxies near the Coma cluster, and indicates intergalactic IGM magnetic fieldsin the range 0.2 to 0.4 $\\mu$G on scales of up to $\\sim$ 4 Mpc. Other patchesof diffuse emission, not previously explored at these high latitudes onarcminute scales, probably contain Galactic ``cirrus''. A strikinganticorrelation is found between low-level diffuse radio glow and some regionsof enhanced optical galaxy surface density, suggesting that cosmological LargeScale Structure (LSS), normally defined by the baryonic (or dark) matterdensity, is not {\\it uniquely} traced by faint continuum radio glow. Rather,intergalactic diffuse synchrotron radiation represents IGM magnetic and Cosmicray energy density, instead of matter density. The diffuse, arcminute-levelstructures over a large region of sky are potentially important pathfinders toCMB foreground radiation on high multipole scales.",

However, the nodes on the boundary of suchnetworks cannot benefit from this strategy, as the other nodes do not depend onthem. This problem is sometimes known as the curse of the boundary nodes. Toovercome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, inwhich the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbonenodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willingto forward the boundary nodes' packets. The stability of the coalitions isstudied using the concept of a core. Then two types of fairness, namely, themin-max fairness using nucleolus and the average fairness using the Shapleyfunction are investigated. Finally, a protocol is designed using both repeatedgames and coalition games. Simulation results show how boundary nodes andbackbone nodes form coalitions together according to different fairnesscriteria. The proposed protocol can improve the network connectivity by about50%, compared with pure repeated game schemes.",

Weshow that for any growing cells whose gene expression is under stochasticfluctuations, adaptive cellular state is inevitably selected by noise, evenwithout specific signal transduction network for it. In general, changes inprotein concentration in a cell are given by its synthesis minus dilution anddegradation, both of which are proportional to the rate of cell growth. In anadaptive state with a higher growth speed, both terms are large and balanced.Under the presence of noise in gene expression, the adaptive state is lessaffected by stochasticity since both the synthesis and dilution terms arelarge, while for a non-adaptive state both the terms are smaller so that cellsare easily kicked out of the original state by noise. Hence, escape time from acellular state and the cellular growth rate are negatively correlated. Thisleads to a selection of adaptive states with higher growth rates, and modelsimulations confirm this selection to take place in general. The resultssuggest a general form of adaptation that has never been brought to light - aprocess that requires no specific machineries for sensory adaptation. Thepresent scheme may help explain a wide range of cellular adaptive responsesincluding the metabolic flux optimization for maximal cell growth.",

Inthis case $T$ will be called a $J$-class operator. We investigate the class ofoperators satisfying the above property and provide various examples. It isworthwhile to mention that many results from the theory of hypercyclicoperators have their analogues in this setting.

This sensorycompensation will enable individuals with spinal cord injuries to be aware of alocalized excess of pressure at the skin/seat interface and, consequently, willenable them to prevent the formation of pressure ulcers by relieving thecutaneous area of suffering.

We examine the spatial distribution of turn-off stars anddemonstrate that all belong to NGC 1846 rather than to any field starpopulation. In addition, the spatial distributions of the two sets of turn-offstars may exhibit different central concentrations and some asymmetries. Byfitting isochrones, we show that the properties of the colour-magnitude diagramcan be explained if there are two stellar populations of equivalent metalabundance in NGC 1846, differing in age by approximately 300 Myr. The absoluteages of the two populations are ~1.9 and ~2.2 Gyr, although there may be asystematic error of up to +/-0.4 Gyr in these values. The metal abundanceinferred from isochrone fitting is [M/H] ~ -0.40, consistent with spectroscopicmeasurements of [Fe/H]. We propose that the observed properties of NGC 1846 canbe explained if this object originated via the tidal capture of two starclusters formed separately in a star cluster group in a single giant molecularcloud. This scenario accounts naturally for the age difference and uniformmetallicity of the two member populations, as well as the differences in theirspatial distributions.",

In the multicanonical MD, the estimation of the derivative ofthe density of states is critical. In order to estimate it accurately, wedevise two original improvements. First, the correction for the density ofstates is made smooth by using the Gaussian distribution obtained by a shortcanonical simulation. Second, an approximation is applied to the derivative,which is based on the Gaussian distribution and the multiple weighted histogramtechnique. A test of this method was performed with small polypeptides,Met-enkephalin and Trp-cage, and it is demonstrated that Wang-Landau MD isconsistent with replica exchange MD but can sample much larger conformationalspace.",

It has beenthen stated that this implies that either locally dark matter is notdistributed in the same way as luminous matter, or peculiar velocities are notdue to fluctuations in mass. To test that statement a set of constrained N-bodycosmological simulations, designed to reproduce the main observed large scalestructure, have been analyzed. The simulations were performed within theflat-Lambda, open and flat matter only CDM cosmogonies. Two unconstrainedsimulations of the flat-Lambda and open CDM models were performed forcomparison. LG-like objects have been selected so as to mimic the real LGenvironment. The local gravitational field due to all halos found within eachLV is compared with the exact gravitational field induced by all matter in thesimulation. We conclude that there is no correlation between the exact and thelocal gravitational field obtained by pairwise newtonian forces between halos.Moreover, the local gravitational field is uncorrelated with the peculiarvelocities of halos. The exact gravitational field has a linear correlationwith peculiar velocities but the proportionality constant relating the velocitywith gravitational field falls below the prediction of the linear theory. Uponconsidering all matter inside the LVs, the exact and local gravitationalaccelerations show a much better correlation, but with a considerable scatterindependent on the cosmological models. The main conclusion is that the lack ofcorrelation between the local gravitation and the peculiar velocity fieldsaround LG-like objects is naturally expected in the CDM cosmologies.",

        "abstract": "In time hopping impulse radio, $N_f$ pulses of duration $T_c$ are transmittedfor each information symbol. This gives rise to two types of processing gain:(i) pulse combining gain, which is a factor $N_f$, and (ii) pulse spreadinggain, which is $N_c=T_f/T_c$, where $T_f$ is the mean interval between twosubsequent pulses. This paper investigates the trade-off between these twotypes of processing gain in the presence of timing jitter. First, an additivewhite Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is considered and approximate closed formexpressions for bit error probability are derived for impulse radio systemswith and without pulse-based polarity randomization. Both symbol-synchronousand chip-synchronous scenarios are considered. The effects of multiple-accessinterference and timing jitter on the selection of optimal system parametersare explained through theoretical analysis. Finally, a multipath scenario isconsidered and the trade-off between processing gains of a synchronous impulseradio system with pulse-based polarity randomization is analyzed. The effectsof the timing jitter, multiple-access interference and inter-frame interferenceare investigated. Simulation studies support the theoretical results.",

Instead of gauge fixing some of the superspacecoordinates to zero, we impose an additional constraint on them reproducing thesimplifications of the supersolvable representations. The constraints arequadratic, homogeneous, Sp(4,R)-covariant, and consistent from the quantumpoint of view in the pure spinor approach.

We have analyzed spectral signatures of theturbulence for different sets of parameters and different altitudes relative tothe turning point of the linear Langmuir mode where the Langmuir frequencyequals the local plasma frequency. By a parametric analysis, we have derived asimple scaling law, which links the spectral width of the turbulent frequencyspectrum to the physical parameters in the ionosphere. The scaling law providesa quantitative relation between the physical parameters (temperatures, electronnumber density, ionospheric length scale, etc.) and the observed frequencyspectrum.

Because the comb is self-calibrating and can be shifted intothe ultraviolet spectral region via harmonic generation, it offers the prospectof greatly improved accuracy for UV and far-UV transitions. To take advantageof this accuracy an ultracold helium sample is needed. For measurements of thetriplet spectrum a magneto-optical trap (MOT) can be used to cool and trapmetastable 2^3S state atoms. We analyze schemes for measuring the two-photon$2^3S \\to 4^3S$ interval, and for resonant two-photon excitation to highRydberg states, $2^3S \\to 3^3P \\to n^3S,D$.

Galaxies in the FLASH and 6dFGS redshift surveysare cross-identified with NVSS radio sources, selected in a subsample doublycomplete in volume and luminosity. Environmental effects are studied through asmoothed density field (normalized with random catalogs with the same surveyedges and redshift selection function) and the distance to the nearest cluster(R/r200, where r200 is the virial radius, whose relation to the aperturevelocity dispersion is quantified). The fraction of high radio loudness(R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the coreof the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K isanti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlatedwith R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10xless radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness inthe SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. Thiscorrelation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200(K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR. The suppression of radioloudness in SSC-CR BCGs can be attributed to cluster-cluster mergers thatdestroy the cool core and thus the supply of gas to the central AGN. Weanalytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies withinSSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapidgalaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced rampressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 mergingclusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2nd cluster.",

Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensionsreliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of thephenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNRof the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurementsrequired for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widelydealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there wasmotivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derivethese bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithmindependent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In thisdirection we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds tothe probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortioncriteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upperbounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacitygoes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means thatdisproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Ournext main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity onsensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensingdiversity is related to the effective \\emph{coverage} of a sensor with respectto the field. In this direction we show the following results (a) Sensingcapacity goes down as sensing diversity per sensor goes down; (b) Randomsampling (coverage) of the field by sensors is better than contiguous locationsampling (coverage).",

We perform a time resolvedspectral analysis, and show that the sum of a power-law and a black-body givesacceptable fits to the time dependent spectra within the BATSE energy range,but overpredicts the flux in the WFC X-ray range. Moreover, a fit with a cutoffpower-law plus a black-body is consistent with the WFC data, but the black-bodycomponent contributes a negligible fraction of the total flux.

We then construct a parameterized family ofnon-analytic functions with this same property. With the possible exception ofa finite number of zeros off the critical line, every function in the familysatisfies a Riemann Hypothesis. Moreover, when the parameter is not too large,they have about the same number of zeros as the zeta-function, their zeros areall simple, and they \"repel\".

This approach isbased on the identification of a suitable matrix representation of themultiplication operator associated with the corresponding orthogonalitymeasure. Two different alternatives are discussed, depending whether we use forthe matrix representation the standard basis of orthogonal rational functions,or a new one with poles alternatively located in the exterior and the interiorof the unit circle. The corresponding representations are linear fractionaltransformations with matrix coefficients acting respectively on Hessenberg andfive-diagonal unitary matrices.  In consequence, the orthogonality measure can be recovered from the spectralmeasure of an infinite unitary matrix depending uniquely on the poles and theparameters of the recurrence relation for the orthogonal rational functions.Besides, the zeros of the orthogonal and para-orthogonal rational functions areidentified as the eigenvalues of matrix linear fractional transformations offinite Hessenberg and five-diagonal matrices.  As an application of this operator approach, we obtain new relations betweenthe support of the orthogonality measure and the location of the poles andparameters of the recurrence relation, generalizing to the rational case knownresults for orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.  Finally, we extend these results to orthogonal polynomials on the real linewith poles in the lower half plane.",

Phenomenologically, the model predicts the existence of Terascale,negative-norm copies of the usual SM fields with rather unique properties:ghost-like propagators and negative decay widths, but with otherwise SM-likecouplings. The model is both unitary and causal on macroscopic scales. In thispaper we examine whether or not such states with these unusual properties canbe uniquely identified as such at the LHC. We find that in the extended strongand electroweak gauge boson sector of the model, which is the simplest one toanalyze, such an identification can be rather difficult. Observation of heavygluon-like resonances in the dijet channel offers the best hope for thisidentification.",

Acousticegression power maps at 3 and 6 mHz with a 2 mHz bandpass reveal a compactacoustic source strongly correlated with impulsive hard X-ray andvisible-continuum emission along the penumbral neutral line separating the twomajor opposing umbrae in the $\\delta$-configuration sunspot that predominatesAR10720. The acoustic emission signatures were directly aligned with both hardX-ray and visible continuum emission that emanated during the flare. Thevisible continuum emission is estimated at $2.0 \\times 10^{23}$ J,approximately 500 times the seismic emission of $\\sim 4 \\times 10^{20}$ J. Theflare of 2005 January 15 exhibits the same close spatial alignment between thesources of the seismic emission and impulsive visible continuum emission asprevious flares, reinforcing the hypothesis that the acoustic emission may bedriven by heating of the low photosphere. However, it is a major exception inthat there was no signature to indicate the inclusion of protons in theparticle beams thought to supply the energy radiated by the flare. Thecontinued strong coincidence between the sources of seismic emission andimpulsive visible continuum emission in the case of a proton-deficientwhite-light flare lends substantial support to the ``back -- warming''hypothesis, that the low photosphere is significantly heated by intense Balmerand Paschen continuum-edge radiation from the overlying chromosphere inwhite-light flares.",

The metallicitiesfor relatively short vertical distances (z<2.5 kpc) show systematicfluctuations with Galactic longitude, similar to those of the thick-discscaleheight, which may be interpreted as indicating a common origin, viz., theflare effect of the disc. This suggestion is supported by the metallicityvariations which we find as functions of radial distance. The metallicityvariation at larger vertical distances (6.5<z<9.5 kpc) is small but monotonic.Three different vertical metallicity gradients could be detected:d[M/H]/dz=-0.22(+/-0.03), d[M/H]/dz=-0.38 (+/-0.06), and d[M/H]/dz=-0.08(+/-0.07) dex/kpc for the intervals z<3, 3<z<5, and 5<z<10 kpc, respectively.Since our data cover the whole Galactic longitude interval, the resultingmetallicity gradients can be interpreted as properties of the larger-scaleGalaxy. The first gradient confirms the dissipational formation of the disc atshort z-distances. The steeper gradient corresponds to the transition regionbetween different population components of the Galaxy, and finally, the lowestvalue provides an adequate description of the inner-halo metallicity gradient.",

A Krylovsubspace approximation based on the Arnoldi algorithm is described for theevaluation of a generic matrix function. The efficiency of the method isspoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. Thisis cured by adding a small number of critical eigenvectors to the Krylovsubspace, for which we propose two different deflation schemes. The ensuingmodified Arnoldi method is then applied to the sign function, which has adiscontinuity along the imaginary axis. The numerical results clearly show theimproved efficiency of the method. Our modification is particularly effectivewhen the action of the sign function of the same matrix has to be computed manytimes on different vectors, e.g., if the overlap Dirac operator is invertedusing an iterative method.",

We search for these correlations by analyzing the most recent radio and X-raydata available in the literature for a well known sample of clusters with giantradio halos. In particular we find a good correlation between P_R and R_H and avery tight ``geometrical'' scaling between M_H and R_H. From these correlationsP_R is also expected to scale with M_H and sigma_H and this is confirmed by ouranalysis. We show that all the observed trends can be well reconciled withexpectations in the case of a slight variation of the mean magnetic fieldstrength in the radio halo volume with M_H. A byproduct correlation between R_Hand sigma_H is also found, and can be further tested by optical studies. Inaddition, we find that observationally R_H scales non-linearly with the virialradius of the host cluster, and this immediately means that the fraction of thecluster volume which is radio emitting increases with cluster mass and thusthat the non-thermal component in clusters is not self-similar.",

CCD photometry of the 13 meteors, including 1Perseid, 1 Aquarid, and 11 sporadic meteors, was performed. We defined a peakvideo-rate magnitude by comparing the integrated photon counts from thebrightest portion of the track traversed within 33ms to those from a 0-mag starduring the same time duration. This definition gives magnitudes in the range4.0< V_{vr} <6.4 and 4.1< I_{vr}<5.9 for these 13 meteors. The correspondingmagnitude for virtual naked-eye observers could be somewhat fainter especiallyfor the V-band observation, in which the [OI] 5577 line lasting about 1 sec asan afterglow could contribute to the integrated flux of the present 5-10 minCCD exposures. Although the spatial resolution is insufficient to resolve thesource size of anything smaller than about 1 m, we developed a new estimate ofthe collisionally excited column diameter of these meteors. A diameter as smallas a few mm was derived from their collisionally excited photon rates, meteorspeed, and the volume density of the oxygen atoms at the 100km altitude. Theactual column diameter of the radiating zone, however, could be as large as few100m because the excited atoms travel that distance before they emit forbiddenlines in 0.7 sec of its average lifetime.

Starting from the above evidence,supermassive compact objects at the centre of large-mass galaxies are conceivedas the end-product of the gravitational collapse of local density maxima aroundwhich overdensities are located. At the beginning of evolution, local densitymaxima are idealized as homogeneous peaks, while the surrounding envelopes aredescribed by a power-law density profile. The dependence of the density profileon a second parameter, chosen to be the ratio between peak and total mass, isanalysed. Overdensity evolution is discussed in the context of quintessencecosmological models and further investigation is devoted to a special case withthe aim to describe the central collapse. An empirical relation between holeand dark halo mass is translated into a dependence of the fractional hole masson the overdensity mass. Computations are performed up to the end of centralcollapse, and density profiles of related configurations are determinedtogether with additional parameters. The central collapse is completed in earlytimes, no longer than a few hundredths of Gyr, which implies hole formationwhen proto-haloes, proto-bulges, and proto-disks are still expanding orcontracting. No appreciable change in evolution is found with regard todifferent mean peak heights related to equal masses. On the other hand, it isrecognized that homogeneous peaks collapse ``faster'' with respect tosurroundings envelopes, in low-mass than in large-mass overdensities.

However, two levels ofparameterization keep it easy to tune. Since DWEB mainly meets engineeringbenchmarking needs, it is complimentary to the TPC standard benchmarks, and nota competitor.

In fact, up to now a few different scenarios foracceleration of particles inside open clusters have been considered, i.e.shocks in massive star winds, pulsars and their nebulae, supernova shocks,massive compact binaries. Here we consider in detail the radiation processesdue to both electrons and hadrons accelerated inside the open cluster. As aspecific scenario, we apply the acceleration process at the shocks arising inthe winds of WR type stars. Particles diffuse through the medium of the opencluster during the activity time of the acceleration scenario defined by theage of the WR star. They interact with the matter and radiation, at firstinside the open cluster and, later in the dense surrounding clouds. Wecalculate the broad band spectrum in different processes for three example openclusters (Berk 87, Cyg OB2, Westerlund 2) for which the best observationalconstraints on the spectra are at present available. It is assumed that thehigh energy phenomena, observed from the X-ray up to the GeV-TeV gamma-rayenergies, are related to each other. We conclude that the most likelydescription of the radiation processes in these objects is achieved in thehybrid (leptonic-hadronic) model in which leptons are responsible for theobserved X-ray and GeV gamma-ray emission and hadrons are responsible for theTeV gamma-ray emission, which is produced directly inside and in dense cloudssurrounding the open cluster.",

It has been found that hole doping with Li decreases thesuperconducting transition temperature Tc, but at a slower rate than electrondoping with C or Al. Tc of MgB2 crystals with simultaneously substituted Li forMg and C for B decreases more than in the case where C is substituted alone.This means that holes introduced by Li cannot counterbalance the effect ofdecrease of Tc caused by introduction of electrons coming from C. The possiblereason of it can be that holes coming from Li occupy the pi band whileelectrons coming from C fill the sigma band. The temperature dependences of theupper critical field Hc2 for Al and Li substituted crystals with the same Tcshow a similar dHc2/dT slope at Tc and a similar Hc2(T) behavior, despite ofmuch different substitution level. This indicates that the mechanismcontrolling Hc2 and Tc is similar in both hole and electron doped crystals.Electrical transport measurements show an increase of resistivity both in Lisubstituted crystals and in Li and C co-substituted crystals. This indicatesenhanced scattering due to defects introduced by substitutions includingdistortion of the lattice. The observed behavior can be explained as a resultof two effects, influencing both Tc and Hc2. The first one is doping related tothe changes in the carrier concentration, which may lead to the decrease or tothe increase of Tc.

Hence, the basic physicalmechanisms at play are similar in both cases and can be reduced to thequantization of a parametric oscillator leading to particle creation due to theinteraction with a classical source: pair production in vacuum is thereforeequivalent to the appearance of a growing mode for the cosmologicalfluctuations. The only difference lies in the nature of the source: an electricfield in the case of the Schwinger effect and the gravitational field in thecase of inflationary perturbations. Although, in the laboratory, it isnotoriously difficult to produce an electric field such that pairs extractedfrom the vacuum can be detected, the gravitational field in the early universecan be strong enough to lead to observable effects that ultimately revealthemselves as temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background.Finally, the question of how quantum cosmological perturbations can beconsidered as classical is discussed at the end of the article.",

Using detailedhydrodynamic simulations of gas clouds in minihalos subject to destructiveprocesses associated with the encompassing intergalactic shocks carryingmetal-enriched gas, we find, as an example, that, for realistic shocks ofvelocities of 10-100km/s, more than (90%,65%) of the high density gas withrho>500 rhob inside a minihalo virialized at z=10 of mass (10^7,10^6)Msunremains at a metallicity lower than 3% of that of the intergalactic medium byredshift z=6. It may be expected that the high density gas in minihalos becomesfuel for subsequent star formation, when they are incorporated into largerhalos where efficient atomic cooling can induce gas condensation hence starformation. Since minihalos virialize at high redshift when the universe is notexpected to have been significantly reionized, the implication is that gas invirialized minihalos may provide an abundant reservoir of primordial gas topossibly allow for the formation of Population-III metal-free stars to extendto much lower redshift than otherwise expected based on the enrichment ofintergalactic medium.",

The images of most of the cosmic ray showers look significantlydifferent from those of gamma-rays and are therefore easily discriminated.However, a small fraction of events seems to be indistinguishable fromgamma-rays. This constitutes an irreducible background to the observation ofhigh-energy gamma-ray sources, and limits the sensitivity achievable with agiven instrument. Here, a Monte Carlo study of gamma-like cosmic-ray events ispresented. The nature of gamma-like cosmic-ray events, the shower particlesthat are responsible for the gamma-like appearance, and the dependence of theseresults on the choice of the hadronic interaction model are investigated. Mostof the gamma-like cosmic ray events are characterised by the production ofhigh-energy pi0's early in the shower development which dump most of the showerenergy into electromagnetic sub-showers. Also Cherenkov light from single muonscan mimic gamma-rays in close-by pairs of telescopes.

In five dimensions thesemodels can be given a simple interpretation. Inspired by flux-backgroundsolutions of type IIB supergravity, a metric background that deviates fromAdS_5 in the IR breaks supersymmetry, while the fermion mass hierarchy resultsfrom the wavefunction overlap of bulk fermions with a UV-confined Higgs field.The first and second generation squarks and sleptons, which are localized nearthe IR brane, directly feel the supersymmetry breaking and obtain masses oforder 10 TeV. These are interpreted as composite states of the dual 4D theory.The gauginos and third generation squarks and sleptons are elementary statesthat obtain soft masses of order 1 TeV at the loop level via direct gaugemediation. This particle spectrum leads to distinctive signatures at the LHC,similar to the usual gauge mediation with a neutralino NLSP that decayspromptly to a gravitino LSP, but with lower event rates.

The sample ofpulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsarcharacteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the firsttime and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. Wediscovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emitsingle pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimatedthat at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulseswhen observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available.It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic propertyof the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult orimpossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at bothfrequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possiblyslightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the mostdisordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized intodrifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulationindices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radioemission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steadysignal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. Themeasured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but thereis no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters.",

Our approachcontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations.

We use the thermal conductivity of a fully ionized hydrogen plasmaproposed by Spitzer and a saturated heat flux according to Cowie & McKee inregions where the mean free path of the electrons is large compared to thetemperature scaleheight. Significant structural and evolutionary differencesoccur between simulations with and without heat conduction. Dense clouds inpure dynamical models experience dynamical destruction by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)instability. In static models heat conduction leads to evaporation of suchclouds. Heat conduction acting on clouds in a gas stream smooths out steeptemperature and density gradients at the edge of the cloud because theconduction timescale is shorter than the cooling timescale. This diminishes thevelocity gradient between the streaming plasma and the cloud, so that thetimescale for the onset of KH instabilities increases, and the surface of thecloud becomes less susceptible to KH instabilities. The stabilisation effect ofheat conduction against KH instability is more pronounced for smaller and lessmassive clouds. As in the static case more realistic cloud conditions allowheat conduction to transfer hot material onto the cloud's surface and to mixthe accreted gas deeper into the cloud.",

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that includedust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compareremarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfectagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dustattenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs forgalaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminatedwith an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simpleprescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normalstar-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellarmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, andfor (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinctstar formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-formingand the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lieon a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strongAGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN,while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm ofquiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxiesthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)galaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alphaemission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density atz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).",

By modeling its non-Gaussianity, we measure the mean and scatter invelocity dispersion at fixed richness. The mean velocity dispersion increasesfrom 202+/-10 km/s for small groups to more than 854+/-102 km/s for largeclusters. We show the scatter to be at most 40.5+/-3.5%, declining to14.9+/-9.4% in the richest bins. We test our methods in the C4 cluster catalog,a spectroscopic cluster catalog produced from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR2spectroscopic sample, and in mock galaxy catalogs constructed from N-bodysimulations. Our methods are robust, measuring the scatter to well withinone-sigma of the true value, and the mean to within 10%, in the mock catalogs.By convolving the scatter in velocity dispersion at fixed richness with theobserved richness space density function, we measure the velocity dispersionfunction of the maxBCG galaxy clusters. Although velocity dispersion andrichness do not form a true mass-observable relation, the relationship betweenvelocity dispersion and mass is theoretically well characterized and has lowscatter. Thus our results provide a key link between theory and observations upto the velocity bias between dark matter and galaxies.",

We do so for systems withinfinite energy scale separation between magnetic and electric excitations, sothat the magnetic closed loop structure is fully preserved while the electricloop structure is tampered with by thermally excited electric charges. We findthat the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and systemsize, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite systemsize do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topologicalentropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for anyinfinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant asthe temperature is further increased. Such discontinuous behavior is replacedby a smooth decreasing function in finite-size systems. If the separation ofenergy scales in the system is large but finite, we argue that our results holdat small enough temperature and finite system size, and a second drop in thetopological entropy should occur as the temperature is raised so as to disruptthe magnetic loop structure by allowing the appearance of free magneticcharges. We interpret our results as an indication that the underlying magneticand electric closed loop structures contribute equally to the topologicalentropy (and therefore to the topological order) in the system. Since each loopstructure \\emph{per se} is a classical object, we interpret the quantumtopological order in our system as arising from the ability of the twostructures to be superimposed and appear simultaneously.",

In this paper, we describe the near-UV morphology of theobjects and characterize the near-UV emission. We estimate the size and theluminosity of the emitting regions and extract the luminosity profile. We alsodetermine the presence of unresolved compact nuclei. In addition, thecircumnuclear stellar cluster population is identified, and the contribution ofthe stellar clusters to the total light, at this wavelength, is estimated. Thesize of the sample allows us to draw robust statistical conclusions. We findthat {Seyfert 1} galaxies are completely dominated by its bright and compactnucleus, that remains point-like at this resolution, while we find almost nounresolved nucleus in Seyfert 2. The Seyfert types 1 and 2 are quite segregatedin an asymmetry vs compactness plot. Stellar clusters are found somewhat morefrequently in Sy2 (in ~70% of the galaxies) than in Sy1 (~57%), and contributemore to the total light in Sy2, but this two differences seem to be mostly dueto the large contribution of the compact nucleus in Sy1, as the luminositydistribution of the clusters is similar in both Sy types.",

Starting with all areas being disconnected,pairs of areas with similar sets of features are linked together, in an attemptto recover the original network structure. Inferring primate corticalconnectivity from the properties of the nodes, remarkably good reconstructionsof the global network organization could be obtained, with the topologicalfeatures allowing slightly superior accuracy to the spatial ones. Analogousreconstruction attempts for the C. elegans neuronal network resulted insubstantially poorer recovery, indicating that cortical area interconnectionsare relatively stronger related to the considered topological and spatialproperties than neuronal projections in the nematode. The close relationshipbetween area-based features and global connectivity may hint on developmentalrules and constraints for cortical networks. Particularly, differences betweenthe predictions from topological and spatial properties, together with thepoorer recovery resulting from spatial properties, indicate that theorganization of cortical networks is not entirely determined by spatialconstraints.",

After stabilizing the modulus, it is possible toobtain observed values of the mass ratio between the fundamental energy scalesand a tiny effective cosmological constant (though its sign is negative).

When $h_{ac}$ is parallel to $H_{dc}$ we observe that eachvortex penetration event produces a significant supression of the ac lossesbecause the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility as a function of $H_{dc}$increases before the penetration of vortices, and then it decreases abruptlyafter vortices have entered into the sample. In the second case, when $h_{ac}$is perpendicular to $H_{dc}$, we observe that the jumps in dissipation occur atthe same values of $H_{dc}$ but are much smaller than in the parallelconfiguration. The behavior of the dissipation in the perpendicularconfiguration is similar to previous results obtained in recent microwaveexperiments using mesoscopic litographed squares of Pb [J. Low Temp.

Material in dense filaments penetrates deeper to about half thatradius. With cooling the virial shock position shrinks and also the filamentsreach scales as small as a third the virial radius. The temperatures inprotogalaxies found in adiabatic simulations decrease by a factor of two fromthe center and show flat entropy cores.

Weobserve turbulent Mach numbers ranging from one to three in the cooling cases.This turbulence is driven by the large scale merging and interestingly remainssupersonic in the centers of these early galaxies even in the absence of anyfeedback processes. The virial theorem is shown to approximately hold over 3orders of magnitude in length scale with the turbulent pressure prevailing overthe thermal energy.

We demonstrate that theexperimentally observed linear decrease in T_c with dilution is not the simplemean-field result, but a combination of the effects of fluctuations, theexchange interaction and the hyperfine coupling. Furthermore, we find acritical dilution x_c=0.21(2), below which there is no ordering. In agreementwith recent Monte Carlo simulations on a similar model, we find no evidence ofthe experimentally observed freezing of the glassy state in our calculation. Weapply the theory of Stephen and Aharony to LiHo_{x}Y_{1-x}F_4 and find that thetheory does predict a finite-temperature freezing of the spin glass. Reasonsfor the discrepancies are discussed.",

Three distinct phasesare considered, namely the so-called spin-pseudospin, spin, and pseudospinphases. The first corresponds to a quarter-filled (\\nu =-1) while the others toa half-filled (\\nu = 0) lowest Landau level.

The boson representation of theprojected electron density, the spin, pseudospin, and mixed spin-pseudospindensity operators are derived. We then apply the developed formalism to theeffective continuous model, which includes SU(4) symmetry breaking terms,recently proposed by Alicea and Fisher. For each quantum Hall state, aneffective interacting boson model is derived and the dispersion relations ofthe elementary excitations are analytically calculated. We propose that thecharged excitations (quantum Hall skyrmions) can be described as a coherentstate of bosons. We calculate the semiclassical limit of the boson modelderived from the SU(4) invariant part of the original fermionic Hamiltonian andshow that it agrees with the results of Arovas and co-workers for SU(N) quantumHall skyrmions.

Aims: We present the first proper motion measurements ofthe thin dust filaments observed in the central parsec around SgrA* andinvestigate possible mechanisms that could be responsible for the observedmotions. Methods: The observations have been carried out using the NACOadaptive optics system at the ESO VLT. The images have been transformed to acommon coordinate system and features of interest were extracted. Then across-correlation technique could be performed in order to determine theoffsets between the features with respect to their position in the referenceepoch. Results: We derive the proper motions of a number of filaments and 2cometary shaped dusty sources close (in projection) to SgrA*. We show that theshape and the motion of the filaments does not agree with a purely Keplerianmotion of the gas in the potential of the supermassive black hole at theposition of SgrA*. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be responsible fortheir formation and motion. We argue that the properties of the filaments areprobably related to an outflow from the disk of young mass-losing stars aroundSgrA*. In part, the outflow may originate from the black hole itself.

Although great progress has been made in modelling the disk with radiativetransfer models able to reproduce the spectral energy distribution (SED) ofHerbig Ae stars, the constraints brought by images have not been yet fullyexploited.

Using the accurate X-ray position allowed bySwift/XRT data, we pinpointed the optical counterpart, a M2 III star. Besides,the combined use of the spectral information afforded by XRT and INTEGRAL/IBISshows that the 0.5-200 keV spectrum of this source can be described with anabsorbed Comptonization model, usually found in LMXBs and, in particular, inSyXBs. No long-term (days to months) periodicities are detected in the IBISdata. The time coverage afforded by XRT reveals shot-noise variability typicalof accreting Galactic X-ray sources, but is not good enough to explore thepresence of X-ray short-term (seconds to hours) oscillations in detail. Byusing the above information, we infer important parameters for this source suchas its distance (about 3.7 kpc) and X-ray luminosity (about 1.4e35 erg/s in the0.5-200 keV band), and we give a description for this system (typical of SyXBs)in which a compact object (possibly a neutron star) accretes from the wind ofits M-type giant companion.

For typical starting red-shiftsthe effect of finite particle number is to {\\it slow down} slightly the growthof power compared to that in the fluid limit (e.g. by about ten percent at halfthe Nyquist frequency), and to induce also dispersion in the growth as afunction of direction at a comparable level. In the limit that the initialred-shift tends to infinity, at fixed particle density, the evolution in factdiverges from that in the fluid limit (described by the Zeldovichapproximation). Contrary to widely held belief, this means that a simulationstarted at a red-shift much higher than the red-shift of shell crossingactually gives a worse, rather than a better, result. We also study how theseeffects are modified when there is a small-scale regularization of thegravitational force. We show that such a smoothing may reduce the anisotropy ofthe discreteness effects, but it then {\\it increases} their average effect.This behaviour illustrates the fact that the discreteness effects describedhere are distinct from those usually considered in this context, due totwo-body collisions.

The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling (2004), hasgreatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidences and alsoproduces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been appliedsuccessfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee et al. (2006), but theirimplementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounceddegeneracies. Shaw et al.

We show that both models allow asignificant softening but, in the first case the bulk modulus is mainlydependent on the density, while in the mixed phase model it also stronglydepends on the temperature.

The spectral fits have been done in count spaceand include the effects of metallicity, and are compared with the previouslyreported optical and X-ray temporal behaviour. Using the blastwave model andsome assumptions which include on-axis viewing and standard jet structure,constant blastwave energy and no evolution of the microphysical parameters, wefind a mean value of p for the sample as a whole of 2.04 +0.02/-0.03. Astatistical analysis of the distribution demonstrates that the p values in thissample are inconsistent with a single universal value for p at the 3-sigmalevel or greater, which has significant implications for particle accelerationmodels. This approach provides us with a measured distribution of circumburstdensity structures rather than considering only the cases of k=0 (homogeneous)and k=2 (wind-like). We find five GRBs for which k can be well constrained, andin four of these cases the circumburst medium is clearly wind-like. The fifthsource has a value of 0<k<1, consistent with a homogeneous circumburst medium.",

How memories are preserved for months or years, despitemolecular turnover, is not well understood. Ongoing recurrent neuronalactivity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized topreferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesishas not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representingbiochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity intotwo such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essentialbiochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced modelrepresents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailedmodel adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeledas continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states ofsynaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and theamplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic ortheta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a highweight stabilized by ongoing activity. Bistability was robust to parametervariations. Simulations illustrated that prolonged decreased activity resetsynapses to low weights, suggesting a plausible forgetting mechanism. However,episodic activity with shorter inactive intervals maintained strong synapses.Both models support experimental predictions. Tests of these predictions areexpected to further understanding of how neuronal activity is coupled tomaintenance of synaptic strength.",

The first plane is definedby the directions toward which local CMB features are anomalously aligned. Amean preferred axis is also identified in this plane, located very close to theecliptic poles axis. The second plane is defined by the directions anomalouslyavoided by local CMB features. This alignment anomaly provides further insighton recent results (Wiaux et al. 2006).

Thehard X-rays are fit by two power-laws of the same slope, absorbed by columns of1.5 and 7 * 10^{23} cm^{-2} respectively. The spectrum is consistent withprevious suggestions that the power-law components are X-ray emission from thesub-pc VLBI jet and from Bondi accretion at the core, but it is also consistentwith a partial covering interpretation. The soft band is dominated by thermalemission from the diffuse plasma and is fit well by a two-temperature VAPECmodel, plus a third power-law component to account for scattered nuclearemission, jet emission, and emission from X-ray Binaries and other pointsources. Narrow fluorescent emission lines from Fe, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Ni aredetected. The Fe K alpha line width yields a 200 light-day lower limit on thedistance from the black hole to the line-emitting gas.

We demonstrate here in a model and an experiment thatfor a mixture of small and large particles such asymmetric diffusion can arisesolely from an asymmetry in the geometry of the pores of the membrane. Ourdeterministic simulation considers a two-dimensional gas of elastic disks oftwo sizes diffusing through a membrane, and our laboratory experiment examinesthe diffusion of glass beads of two sizes through a metal membrane. In bothexperiment and simulation, the membrane is permeable only to the smallerparticles, and the asymmetric pores lead to an asymmetry in the diffusion ratesof these particles. The presence of even a small percentage of large particlescan clog a membrane, preventing passage of the small particles in one directionwhile permitting free flow of the small particles in the other direction. Thepurely geometric kinetic constraints may play a role in common biologicalcontexts such as membrane ion channels.",

In this work, we calculate the thermalwidth of the quarkonium at finite temperature before it dissolves into openheavy quarks. The input of the calculation are the parton quarkoniumdissociation cross section to NLO in QCD, the quarkonium wave function in atemperature-dependent potential from lattice QCD, and a thermal distribution ofpartons with thermal masses. We find that for the J/psi, the total thermalwidth above 1.4 Tc becomes larger than 100 to 250 MeV, depending on theeffective thermal masses of the quark and gluon, which we take between 400 to600 MeV. Such a width corresponds to an effective dissociation cross section bygluons between 1.5 to 3.5 mb and by quarks 1 to 2 mb at 1.4 Tc. However, atsimilar temperatures, we find a much smaller thermal width and effective crosssection for the upsilon.",

The processes--$\\epsilon$-machines as defined incomputational mechanics--and their interaction networks both provide welldefined notions of structure. This enables us to quantitatively demonstratehierarchical self-organization in the soup in terms of complexity. We foundthat replicating processes evolve the strategy of successively building higherlevels of organization by autocatalysis. Moreover, this is facilitated by localcomponents that have low structural complexity, but high generality. In effect,the finitary process soup spontaneously evolves a selection pressure thatfavors such components. In light of the finitary process soup's generality,these results suggest a fundamental law of hierarchical systems: globalcomplexity requires local simplicity.",

The first approach isbased on a formal solution of the stress transport equation in which theproduction terms can be integrated exactly in terms of matrix exponentials.This formal solution of the subgrid-scale stress transport equation is shown tobe useful to explore special cases, such as the response to constant velocitygradient, but neglecting pressure-strain correlations and diffusion effects.The second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables,combined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averagedLagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the `Recent Fluid Deformation'(RFD) approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basicclosure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrixexponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by itstranspose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown toprovide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow areinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures.The basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated byimplementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropicturbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation ofentirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinearscrambling' terms. But unlike eddy-viscosity closures, the matrix exponentialapproach provides a simple and local closure that can be derived directly fromthe stress transport equation with the production term, and using physicallymotivated assumptions about Lagrangian decorrelation and upstream isotropy.",

The threshold energy for emission increases linear with thefree electron density. We conclude that the work function is a direct measureof the Hartree-Fock exchange energy. Remarkably, the emissions that have beenobserved do not obey the Einstein-Millikan threshold relation for the photoelectric effect. By discrimination between requirements for energy and momentumwe deduce that electron emissions are trigged by photon momentum. We claim thatthe photo electric effect is the result of a phase transition in an electrongas that connects a surface bound, condensed state to a free continuum state.The assignment of a phase transition to the effect under consideration isjustified by analyzing the behaviour of the Fermi-Dirac energy distributionupon raising the Fermi level.

Two kinds ofacceleration regions (annular and core) need to be taken into account. Theannular acceleration region is defined by the magnetic field lines that crossthe null charge surface within the light cylinder. (2). If the potential dropin the annular region of a pulsar is high enough (normally the cases of youngpulsars), charges in both the annular and the core regions could be acceleratedand produce primary gamma-rays. Secondary pairs are generated in both regionsand stream outwards to power the broadband radiations. (3). The potential dropin the annular region grows more rapidly than that in the core region. Theannular acceleration process is a key point to produce wide emission beams asobserved. (4). The advantages of both the polar cap and outer gap models areretained in this model. The geometric properties of the $\\gamma$-ray emissionfrom the annular flow is analogous to that presented in a previous work by Qiaoet al., which match the observations well. (5).

Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a drivingforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has beennoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferentialattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions ofmolecular networks.  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring byincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result ofunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes toquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this initself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sitesin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degreedistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in thenon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantialrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of geneticregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broadto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as amain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that geneduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degreedistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstreamregions of genes.",

        "abstract": "We study the long term evolution of magnetic fields generated by acollisionless relativistic $e^+e^-$ shock which is initially unmagnetized. Our2D particle-in-cell numerical simulations show that downstream of such aWeibel-mediated shock, particle distributions are close to isotropic,relativistic Maxwellians, and the magnetic turbulence is highly intermittentspatially, with the non-propagating magnetic fields forming relatively isolatedregions with transverse dimension $\\sim 10-20$ skin depths. These structuresdecay in amplitude, with little sign of downstream merging. The fields startwith magnetic energy density $\\sim (0.1-0.2)$ of the upstream kinetic energywithin the shock transition, but rapid downstream decay drives the fields tomuch smaller values, below $10^{-3}$ of equipartition after $10^3$ skin depths.  In an attempt to construct a theory that follows field decay to these smallervalues, we explore the hypothesis that the observed damping is a variant ofLandau damping in an unmagnetized plasma. The model is based on the small valueof the downstream magnetic energy density, which suggests that particle orbitsare only weakly perturbed from straight line motion, if the turbulence ishomogeneous. Using linear kinetic theory applied to electromagnetic fields inan isotropic, relativistic Maxwellian plasma, we find a simple analytic formfor the damping rates, $\\gamma_k$, in two and three dimensions for smallamplitude, subluminous electromagnetic fields. We find that magnetic energydoes damp due to phase mixing of current carrying particles as $(\\omega_pt)^{-q}$ with $q \\sim 1$. (abridged)",

The created pairs canupscatter background photons to high energies, which in turn may pair produce,thereby initiating a cascade. The pairs diffuse on the extragalactic magneticfield (EMF) and cascade emission has been suggested as a means for measuringits intensity. Limits on the IR background and EMF are reconsidered taking intoaccount cascade emissions. The cascade equations are solved numerically.Assuming a power-law intrinsic spectrum, the observed 100 MeV - 100 TeVspectrum is found as a function of the intrinsic spectral index and theintensity of the EMF. Cascades emit mainly at or below 100 GeV. The observedTeV spectrum appears softer than for pure absorption when cascade emission istaken into account. The upper limit on the IR photon background is found to berobust. Inversely, the intrinsic spectra needed to fit the TeV data areuncomfortably hard when cascade emission makes a significant contribution tothe observed spectrum. An EMF intensity around 1e-8 nG leads to acharacteristic spectral hump in the GLAST band. Higher EMF intensities divertthe pairs away from the line-of-sight and the cascade contribution to thespectrum becomes negligible.",

From an observational point of viewthis may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most commonstars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observationsof an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Dueto dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of starsmay populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in massthe stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, ifone is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through atelescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them bytheir luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamicalevolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For thedynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code,NBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parametersfrom this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library. Forisolated clusters we found results assimilable to standard stellar populationsynthesis codes such as the PEGASE code. For clusters in a tidal field we foundthat the integrated colors become relatively bluer due to energy equipartitioneffects. In the time shortly before dissolution of the cluster the stellar M/Lratio becomes lower compared to isolated clusters. We compared the results ofour simulations to integrated spectra of galactic globular clusters. For thecluster NGC 1851 we found good agreement between simulation and observation.For extragalactic clusters in M81 and M31 we looked at medium band spectralenergy distributions and found for some clusters also a good agreement.",

It is shownthat for flows with arbitrary shearing rate there exists a finite time intervalof non-adiabatic evolution of the perturbations. The non-adiabatic behaviormanifests itself in a twofold way, viz. by the over-reflection of the GAWs andby the generation of GAWs from EM perturbations. It is shown that thesephenomena act as efficient transformers of the equilibrium flow energy into theenergy of the perturbations for moderate and high shearing rate solar plasmaflows. Efficient generation of GAW by EM takes place for shearing rates aboutan order of magnitude smaller than necessary for development of a shearinstability. The latter fact could have important consequences for the problemof angular momentum redistribution within the Sun and solar-type stars.",

The shape of an unperturbed gaseous disk can be used toconstrain dark matter models. Aims. We derive the 3-D HI volume densitydistribution for the Milky Way out to a galactocentric radius of 40 kpc and aheight of 20 kpc to constrain the Galactic mass distribution. Methods. We usedthe Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey. The transformation frombrightness temperatures to densities depends on the rotation curve. We exploredseveral models, reflecting different dark matter distributions. Each of thesemodels was set up to solve the combined Poisson-Boltzmann equation in aself-consistent way and optimized to reproduce the observed flaring. Results.Besides a massive extended halo of M ~ 1.8 10^{12} Msun, we find aself-gravitating dark matter disk with M=2 to 3 10^{11} Msun, including a darkmatter ring at 13 < R < 18.5 kpc with M = 2.2 to 2.8 10^{10} Msun. Theexistence of the ring was previously postulated from EGRET data and coincideswith a giant stellar structure that surrounds the Galaxy. The resulting MilkyWay rotation curve is flat up to R~27 kpc and slowly decreases outwards. The\\hi gas layer is strongly flaring. The HWHM scale height is 60 pc at R = 4 kpcand increases to ~2700$ pc at R=40 kpc. Spiral arms cause a noticeable imprinton the gravitational field, at least out to R = 30 kpc. Conclusions. Our massmodel supports previous proposals that the giant stellar ring structure is dueto a merging dwarf galaxy. The fact that the majority of the dark matter in theMilky Way for $R \\la 40$ kpc can be successfully modeled by a self-gravitatingisothermal disk raises the question of whether this massive disk may have beencaused by similar merger events in the past.",

Measurements of cosmic ray antiparticles, such as positrons, can imposestrong constraints on the nature of new physics beyond the Standard Model.However, cosmic ray positron measurements are experimentally very challengingdue to the vast proton background. A novel approach of positron identificationwith the space-borne AMS-01 experiment, namely through the detection ofbremsstrahlung conversion in a silicon microstrip detector, is introduced.Bremsstrahlung from protons is suppressed by a factor of more than 3*10^6 withrespect to positrons. The results of the positron measurement show that thebremsstrahlung approach extends the sensitivity range of AMS-01 to positronmomenta up to 50 GeV/c, which is far beyond the original scope of theexperiment. At momenta above 8 GeV/c there is indication for a positronoverabundance with respect to model predictions for purely secondary positronproduction.

Here, we present a shortoverview of these activities which will complement the multi-wavelengthsactivities of the GLAST/LAT collaboration towards the 'low-energy' radio bands.Further we will give a brief outlook including the extension of thiscoordinated campaign towards higher frequencies and future scientific aims.",

        "abstract": "Interaction between metal surface waves and periodic geometry ofsubwavelength structures is at the core of the recent but crucial renewal ofinterest in plasmonics. One of the most intriguing points is the observation ofabnormal strong transmission through these periodic structures, which canexceed by orders of magnitude the classical transmission given by the fillingfactor of the plate. The actual paradigm is that this abnormal transmissionarises from the periodicity, and then that such high transmission shoulddisappear in random geometries. Here, we show that extra energy can be coupledthrough the subwavelength structure by adding a controlled quantity of noise tothe position of the apertures. This result can be modelled in the statisticalframework of stochastic resonance. The evolution of the coupled energy withrespect to noise gives access to the extra energy coupled at the surface of thesubwavelength array.",

In part I, we focus on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy withwhich the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. Morespecifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of theAF scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas andarbitrary number of hops. The DMT is in closed-form expression as a function ofthe number of antennas at each node. First, we provide some basic results onthe DMT of the general Rayleigh product channels. It turns out that theseresults have very simple and intuitive interpretation. Then, the results areapplied to the AF multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to theRayleigh product channel, in the DMT sense. Finally, the project-and-forward(PF) scheme, a variant of the AF scheme, is proposed. We show that the PFscheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significantpower gain over the AF scheme in some cases.

The mixture concentrations are varied from 50:50% to ~10:90% forHCOOH:H2O. Binary mixtures of HCOOH:X and tertiary mixtures of HCOOH:H2O:X withX = CO, CO2, and CH3OH, are studied for concentrations of ~10:90% and~7:67:26%, respectively. Results: Pure HCOOH ice spectra show broad bands whichsplit around 120 K due to the conversion of a dimer to a chain-structure. Broadsingle component bands are found for mixtures with H2O. Additional spectralcomponents are present in mixtures with CO, CO2 and CH3OH. The resulting peakposition, full width at half maximum and band strength depend strongly on icestructure, temperature, matrix constituents and the HCOOH concentration.Comparison of the solid HCOOH 5.9, 7.2, and 8.1 micron features withastronomical data toward the low mass source HH 46 and high mass source W 33Ashows that spectra of binary mixtures do not reproduce the observed icefeatures. However, our tertiary mixtures especially with CH3OH match theastronomical data very well. Thus interstellar HCOOH is most likely present intertiary or more complex mixtures with H2O, CH3OH and potentially also CO orCO2, providing constraints on its formation.",

XO-2 has highmetallicity, [Fe/H]=0.45+/-0.02, high proper motion, mu_tot=157 mas/yr, and hasa common proper motion stellar companion with 31\" separation. The two stars arenearly identical twins, with very similar spectra and apparent magnitudes. Dueto the high metallicity, these early K dwarf stars have a mass and radius closeto solar, Ms=0.98+/-0.02 Msolar and Rs=0.97+0.02/-0.01 Rsolar. The high propermotion of XO-2 results from an eccentric orbit (Galactic pericenter, Rper<4kpc) well confined to the Galactic disk (Zmax~100 pc). In addition, the phasespace position of XO-2 is near the Hercules dynamical stream, which points toan origin of XO-2 in the metal-rich, inner Thin Disk and subsequent dynamicalscattering into the solar neighborhood.

        "abstract": "We investigate the effect of planetary rotation on the transit spectrum of anextrasolar giant planet. During ingress and egress, absorption features arisingfrom the planet's atmosphere are Doppler shifted by of order the planet'srotational velocity (~1-2 km/s) relative to where they would be if the planetwere not rotating. We focus in particular on the case of HD209458b, which oughtto be at least as good a target as any other known transiting planet. ForHD209458b, this shift should give rise to a small net centroid shift of ~60cm/s on the stellar absorption lines. Using a detailed model of thetransmission spectrum due to a rotating star transited by a rotating planetwith an isothermal atmosphere, we simulate the effect of the planet's rotationon the shape of the spectral lines, and in particular on the magnitude of theirwidth and centroid shift. We then use this simulation to determine the expectedsignal-to-noise ratio for distinguishing a rotating from a non-rotating planet,and assess how this S/N scales with various parameters of HD209458b. We findthat with a 6 m telescope, an equatorial rotational velocity of ~2 km/s couldbe detected with a S/N~5 by accumulating the signal over many transits over thecourse of several years.

Among the radio-isotopes, $\\k40$is one of the most abundant and yet whose signatures are difficult to reject.Procedures were devised to measure trace potassium concentrations in theinorganic salt CsI as well as in organic liquid scintillator (LS) withAccelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS), giving, respectively, the$\\k40$-contamination levels of $\\sim 10^{-10}$ and $\\sim 10^{-13}$ g/g.Measurement flexibilities and sensitivities are improved over conventionalmethods. The projected limiting sensitivities if no excess of potassium signalshad been observed over background are $8 \\times 10^{-13}$ g/g and $3 \\times10^{-17}$ g/g for the CsI and LS, respectively. Studies of the LS samplesindicate that the radioactive contaminations come mainly in the dye solutes,while the base solvents are orders of magnitude cleaner.

Similarly to the twistor spaces of'double solid type' on 3CP^2, projective models of present twistor spaces havea natural structure of double covering of a CP^2-bundle over CP^1. Weexplicitly give a defining polynomial of the branch divisor of the doublecovering whose restriction to fibers are degree four.

The Universe is considered aclosed system and allowed to expand adiabatically from the epoch when QSOsfirst ionized the IGM (5 <= z_on <= 20). The average kinetic energy of a gas iscalculated in the region where the gas transitions from relativistic tonon-relativistic behavior. All of the above measurements are then used todetermine the thermal history of the IGM in the redshift range 2.5 <= z <=z_on. The hot IGM is assumed to inverse Compton scatter photons from the CosmicMicrowave Background (CMBR) and consequently distort the CMBR as seen at thepresent epoch. The temperature of the IGM at z=2.5 and the epoch z_on areadjusted, within the constraints defined above, to give the best overallagreement with published data on the temperature of the IGM. We find that themodel of the IGM proposed here does not grossly distort the CMBR, and in factagrees quite closely with the preliminary results from the Cosmic BackgroundExplorer (COBE) satellite. However, our model of the IGM cannot explain theobserved cosmic x ray background.  This paper was originally written in 1990. It was never submitted forpublication.",

The morphology of the diffuse emission strongly resembles that of apulsar wind nebula. The spectrum of the compact source is well-characterized bya power-law with index Gamma approx 1.3, typical of young and energeticrotation-powered pulsars. For a distance of 4.5 kpc, consistent with the X-rayabsorption and an association with the nearby star formation region W33, the2-10 keV X-ray luminosities of the putative pulsar and nebula are L(PSR) =3.2E33 ergs/s and L(PWN) = 1.4E34 ergs/s, respectively. Both the flux ratio ofL(PWN)/L(PSR) = 4.3 and the total luminosity of this system predict a pulsarspin-down power of Edot > 1E37 ergs/s, placing it within the ten most energeticyoung pulsars in the Galaxy.

Our SDI devices use a double Wollaston prism and a quad filterto take images simultaneously at 3 wavelengths surrounding the 1.62 um methaneabsorption bandhead found in the spectrum of cool brown dwarfs and gas giantplanets. In our VLT data, we achieved H band contrasts > 10 mag (5 sigma) at aseparation of 0.5\" from the primary star on 45% of our targets and H bandcontrasts of > 9 mag at a separation of 0.5'' on 80% of our targets. With thisdegree of attenuation, we should be able to image (5sigma detection) a 5M_{Jup} planet 15 AU from a 70 Myr K1 star at 15 pc or a 5 M_{Jup} planet at 2AU from a 12 Myr M star at 10 pc.

This work is a straightforward extension of Ostriker(1999) who studied the case of a straight-line trajectory. The circular orbitcauses the bending of the wake in the background medium along the orbit,forming a long trailing tail. The wake distribution is thus asymmetric, givingrise to the drag forces in both opposite (azimuthal) and lateral (radial)directions to the motion of the perturber, although the latter does notcontribute to orbital decay much. For subsonic motion, the density wake with aweak tail is simply a curved version of that in Ostriker and does not exhibitthe front-back symmetry. The resulting drag force in the opposite direction isremarkably similar to the finite-time, linear-trajectory counterpart. On theother hand, a supersonic perturber is able to overtake its own wake, possiblymultiple times, and develops a very pronounced tail. The supersonic tailsurrounds the perturber in a trailing spiral fashion, enhancing the perturbeddensity at the back as well as far front of the perturber. We provide thefitting formulae for the drag forces as functions of the Mach number, whoseazimuthal part is surprisingly in good agreement with the Ostriker's formula,provided Vp t=2 Rp, where Vp and Rp are the velocity and orbital radius of theperturber, respectively.",

Italso allows a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigoroustesting of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters,regardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of thecurves gives the following results: (1) In accord with our previous findings,the central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, itswidth is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strongcorrelations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region,and within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with extreme(i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic extinctioncurves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightlinevariation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curvewill always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an averagecurve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result insignificant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED mustinclude the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed largesightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among thevarious features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterizeaverage extinction properties, they demonstrate that extinction curves respondsensitively to local conditions.

These oscillations arepowered by release of the binding energy of matter falling into the stronggravitational field of the star or by the sudden nuclear burning of matter thathas accumulated in the outermost layers of the star. The frequencies of theoscillations reflect the orbital frequencies of gas deep in the gravitationalfield of the star and/or the spin frequency of the star. These oscillations cantherefore be used to explore fundamental physics, such as strong-field gravityand the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and importantastrophysical questions, such as the formation and evolution of millisecondpulsars. Observations using RossiXTE have shown that some two dozen neutronstars in low-mass X-ray binary systems have the spin rates and magnetic fieldsrequired to become millisecond radio-emitting pulsars when accretion ceases,but that few have spin rates above about 600 Hz. The properties of these starsshow that the paucity of spin rates greater than 600 Hz is due in part to themagnetic braking component of the accretion torque and to the limited amount ofangular momentum that can be accreted in such systems. Further study will showwhether braking by gravitational radiation is also a factor. Analysis of thekilohertz oscillations has provided the first evidence for the existence of theinnermost stable circular orbit around dense relativistic stars that ispredicted by strong-field general relativity.

We investigate the cross-covariance betweenthe cosmic shear power spectra and the cluster counts based on the halo modelapproach, where the cross-covariance arises from the three-point correlationsof the underlying mass density field. Fully taking into account thecross-covariance as well as non-Gaussian errors on the lensing power spectrumcovariance, we find a significant cross-correlation between the lensing powerspectrum signals at multipoles l~10^3 and the cluster counts containing haloswith masses M>10^{14}Msun. Including the cross-covariance for the combinedmeasurement degrades and in some cases improves the total signal-to-noiseratios up to plus or minus 20% relative to when the two are independent. Forcosmological parameter determination, the cross-covariance has a smaller effectas a result of working in a multi-dimensional parameter space, implying thatthe two observables can be considered independent to a good approximation. Wealso discuss that cluster count experiments using lensing-selected mass peakscould be more complementary to cosmic shear tomography than mass-selectedcluster counts of the corresponding mass threshold. Using lensing selectedclusters with a realistic usable detection threshold (S/N~6 for a ground-basedsurvey), the uncertainty on each dark energy parameter may be roughly halved bythe combined experiments, relative to using the power spectra alone.",

Observational data spanningType Ia Supernovae, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), galaxy clustering,and weak gravitational lensing statistics are fit without requiring the twometa-parameters to be equal. This technique checks for inconsistency betweendifferent data sets, as well as for internal inconsistency within any one dataset (e.g., CMB or lensing statistics) that is sensitive to both geometry andgrowth. We find that the cosmological constant model is consistent with currentdata. Theories of modified gravity generally predict a relation between growthand geometry that is different from that of general relativity.Parameter-splitting can be viewed as a crude way to parametrize the space ofsuch theories. Our analysis of current data already appears to put sharp limitson these theories: assuming a flat universe, current data constrain thedifference Omega_Lambda(geom) - Omega_Lambda(grow) to be -0.0044 +/- 0.0058(68% C.L.); allowing the equation of state w to vary, the difference w(geom) -w(grow) is constrained to be 0.37 +/- 0.37 (68% C.L.).

Weuse the linear intrinsic alignment model as a base and compare it to analternative model and data. If intrinsic alignments are ignored then the darkenergy equation of state is biased by ~50 per cent. We examine how the numberof tomographic redshift bins affects uncertainties on cosmological parametersand find that when intrinsic alignments are included two or more times as manybins are required to obtain 80 per cent of the available information.

To try to explain why caustic crossing lightcurves appear to be so dominant among the published binary lensing events, weinvestigate the influence of several physical effects, including blending,sampling rate, and various binary populations.",

        "abstract": "The topological insulator is an electronic phase stabilized by spin-orbitcoupling that supports propagating edge states and is not adiabaticallyconnected to the ordinary insulator. In several ways it is a spin-orbit-inducedanalogue in time-reversal-invariant systems of the integer quantum Hall effect(IQHE). This paper studies the topological insulator phase in disorderedtwo-dimensional systems, using a model graphene Hamiltonian introduced by Kaneand Mele as an example. The nonperturbative definition of a topologicalinsulator given here is distinct from previous efforts in that it involvesboundary phase twists that couple only to charge, does not refer to edgestates, and can be measured by pumping cycles of ordinary charge. In thisdefinition, the phase of a Slater determinant of electronic states isdetermined by a Chern parity analogous to Chern number in the IQHE case.Numerically we find, in agreement with recent network model studies, that thedirect transition between ordinary and topological insulators that occurs inband structures is a consequence of the perfect crystalline lattice.Generically these two phases are separated by a metallic phase, which isallowed in two dimensions when spin-orbit coupling is present. The sameapproach can be used to study three-dimensional topological insulators.",

However, new proteinfunctions evolve when selection begins to favor other, \"promiscuous\" functionsthat are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that areneutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function causesubstantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enablefuture functional evolution.  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining howcytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity ona single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions onfive other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as muchas four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuousactivities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largelyrationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. Theactivities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinatedfashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the changein one function based on the measurement of several others.  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can leadto substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently underselection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functionalevolution should selection \"ask new questions\" in the future.",

The bucketingquad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two foreach layer. The results show that this method performs better than the quadtree if there are more divisions per layer. This confirms our suspicions thatthe algorithm works better if it gets to look at the data with higherresolution images.

Due to theexchange interaction between the conduction electrons and the impurities, therearises a giant Zeeman splitting in the presence of a moderately low magneticfield. As a consequence, when the quantum well is magnetically doped thecurrent-voltage characteristics shows two peaks corresponding to transport foreach spin channel. This behavior is experimentally observed and can bereproduced with a simple tunneling model. The model thus allows to analyzeother configurations. First, we further increase the magnetic field, whichleads to a spin polarization of the electronic current injected from the leads,thus giving rise to a relative change in the current amplitude. We demonstratethat the spin polarization in the emitter can be determined from such a change.Furthermore, in the case of a magnetically doped injector our model shows alarge increase in peak amplitude and a shift of the resonance to highervoltages as the external field increases. We find that this effect arises froma combination of giant Zeeman splitting, 3-D incident distribution and broadresonance linewidth.",

The latest X-ray flare, detected with XMM-Newton, is notable for itsdetailed lightcurve, yielding not only the highest quality period thus far, butalso important structure reflecting the geometry of the emitting region. RecentMHD simulations of Sgr A*'s disk have demonstrated the growth of a Rossby waveinstability, that enhances the accretion rate for several hours, possiblyaccounting for the observed flares. In this Letter, we carry out ray-tracingcalculations in a Schwarzschild metric to determine as accurately as possiblethe lightcurve produced by general relativistic effects during such adisruption. We find that the Rossby wave induced spiral pattern in the disk isan excellent fit to the data, implying a disk inclination angle of ~77 deg.Note, however, that if this association is correct, the observed period is notdue to the underlying Keplerian motion but, rather, to the pattern speed. Thefavorable comparison between the observed and simulated lightcurves providesimportant additional evidence that the flares are produced in Sgr A*'s innerdisk.",

Effects of initial mixedness, however, on thesubsequent decoherence of MQSs have been less known. In this paper, we studythe evolution of a highly mixed MQS interacting with an environment, andcompare it with that of a pure MQS having the same size of the central distancebetween its component states. Although the decoherence develops more rapidlyfor the mixed MQS in short times, its rate can be significantly suppressedafter a certain time and becomes smaller than the decoherence rate of itscorresponding pure MQS. In an optics experiment to generate a MQS, our resulthas a practical implication that nonclassicality of a MQS can be stillobservable in moderate times even though a large amount of noise is added tothe initial state.",

The scattering is due to two-magnon processes and iscalculated within a linear spin-wave expansion of the Heisenberg spin model forthis compound, including longer range and cyclic spin interactions.

A threecomponent (labels 1, 2, 3) mixture of Fermions is considered where thecomponents 1 and 2 interact and, for instance, form pairs whereas the component3 is in the normal state. For cooling, the components 2 and 3 are coupled by anelectromagnetic field. Since the quasiparticle distributions in the paired andin the normal states are different, the coupling leads to cooling of the normalstate even when initially $T_{paired}\\geq T_{normal}$ (notation $T_S\\geq T_N$).The cooling efficiency is given by the pairing energy and by the linewidth ofthe coupling field. No superfluidity is required: any type of pairing, or otherphenomenon that produces a suitable spectral density, is sufficient. Inprinciple, the paired state could be cooled as well but this requires$T_N<T_S$. The method has a conceptual analogy to cooling based onsuperconductor -- normal metal (SN) tunneling junctions. Main differences arisefrom the exact momentum conservation in the case of the field-matter couplingvs. non-conservation of momentum in the solid state tunneling process.Moreover, the role of processes that relax the energy conservation requirementin the tunneling, e.g. thermal fluctuations of an external reservoir, is nowplayed by the linewidth of the field.

Such intermediate massratio inspirals (IMRIs) are most likely to be found in globular clusters. Weanalyze four possible IMRI formation mechanisms: (1) hardening of an NS-IMBH orBH-IMBH binary via three-body interactions, (2) hardening via Kozai resonancein a hierarchical triple system, (3) direct capture, and (4) inspiral of acompact object from a tidally captured main-sequence star; we also discusstidal effects when the inspiraling object is an NS. For each mechanism wepredict the typical eccentricities of the resulting IMRIs. We find that IMRIswill have largely circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band ofground-based detectors. Hardening of a binary via three-body interactions,which is likely to be the dominant mechanism for IMRI formation, yieldseccentricities under 10^-4 when the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. Even amongIMRIs formed via direct captures, which can have the highest eccentricities,around 90% will circularize to eccentricities under 0.1 before the GW frequencyreaches 10 Hz. We estimate the rate of IMRI coalescences in globular clustersand the sensitivity of a network of three Advanced LIGO detectors to theresulting GWs. We show that this detector network may see up to tens of IMRIsper year, although rates of one to a few per year may be more plausible.

        "abstract": "This paper describes the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) under constructionat the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (RSAA) of the AustralianNational University (ANU) for the ANU 2.3m telescope at the Siding SpringObservatory. WiFeS is a powerful integral field, double-beam, concentric,image-slicing spectrograph designed to deliver excellent thoughput, wavelengthstability, spectrophotometric performance and superb image quality along withwide spectral coverage throughout the 320-950 nm wavelength region. It providesa 25x38 arcsec. field with 0.5 arcsec. sampling along each of twenty five 38X1arcsec slitlets. The output format is optimized to match the 4096x4096 pixelCCD detectors in each of two cameras individually optimized for the blue andthe red ends of the spectrum, respectively. A process of \"interleavednod-and-shuffle\" will be applied to permit quantum noise-limited skysubtraction. Using VPH gratings, spectral resolutions of 3000 and 7000 areprovided. The full spectral range is covered in a single exposure at R=3000,and in two exposures in the R=7000 mode. The use of transmissive coated optics,VPH gratings and optimized mirror coatings ensures a throughput (includingtelescope atmosphere and detector) > 30% over a wide spectral range. Theconcentric image-slicer design ensures an excellent and uniform image qualityacross the full field. To maximize scientific return, the whole instrument isconfigured for remote observing, pipeline data reduction, and the accumulationof calibration image libraries.",

One of the most convincing observational arguments in favor of apropagation-induced variability scenario is the observed annual modulation inthe characteristic time scale of the variation due to the Earth's orbitalmotion. So far there are only two sources known with a well-constrainedseasonal cycle. Annual modulation has been proposed for a few other lesswell-documented objects. However, for some other IDV sources source-intrinsicstructural variations which cause drastic changes in the variability time scalewere also suggested. J1128+592 is a recently discovered, highly variable IDVsource. Previous, densely time-sampled flux-density measurements with theEffelsberg 100-m radio telescope (Germany) and the Urumqi 25-m radio telescope(China), strongly indicate an annual modulation of the time scale. The mostrecent 4 observations in 2006/7, however, do not fit well to the annualmodulation model proposed before. In this paper, we investigate a possibleexplanation of this discrepancy.",

Heating, radiativetransport, and cooling are computed self-consistently with the structure bysolving the equations of radiation MHD in the shearing-box approximation. Usinga fully 3-d and energy-conserving code, we compute the structure and energybalance of this disk segment over a span of more than forty cooling times. Asis also true when gas pressure dominates, the disk's upper atmosphere ismagnetically-supported. However, unlike the gas-dominated case, no steady-stateis reached; instead, the total (i.e., radiation plus gas) energy contentfluctuates by factors of 3--4 over timescales of several tens of orbits, withno secular trend. Because the radiation pressure varies much more than the gaspressure, the ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure varies over theapproximate range 0.5--2. The volume-integrated dissipation rate generallyincreases with increasing total energy, but the mean trend is somewhat slowerthan linear, and the instantaneous dissipation rate is often a factor of twolarger or smaller than the mean for that total energy level. Locally, thedissipation rate per unit volume scales approximately in proportion to thecurrent density; the time-average dissipation rate per unit mass isproportional to m^{-1/2}, where m is the horizontally-averaged mass columndensity to the nearer of the top or bottom surface. As in our earlier study ofa gas-dominated shearing-box, we find that energy transport is completelydominated by radiative diffusion, with Poynting flux carrying less than 1% ofthe energy lost from the box.",

The density of states and the ferromagnetic transition temperatureof a Spin-Fermion model applied to DMS are evaluated using Dynamical Mean-FieldTheory (DMFT) and Monte Carlo (MC) calculations. It is shown that the additionof a square-well-like attractive potential can generate an IB at small enoughMn doping $x$ for values of the $p-d$ exchange $J$ that are not strong enoughto generate one by themselves. We observe that the IB merges with the VB when$x >= x_c$ where $x_c$ is a function of $J$ and the Coulomb attraction strength$V$. Using MC calculations, we demonstrate that the range of the Coulombattraction plays an important role. While the on-site attraction, that has beenused in previous numerical simulations, effectively renormalizes $J$ for allvalues of $x$, an unphysical result, a nearest-neighbor range attractionrenormalizes $J$ only at very low dopings, i.e., until the bound holes wavefunctions start to overlap. Thus, our results indicate that the Coulombattraction can be neglected to study Mn doped GaSb, GaAs, and GaP in therelevant doping regimes, but it should be included in the case of Mn doped GaNthat is expected to be in the IB regime.",

Wetest whether light-cone effects are important and whether the scaling relationsused to compensate for an incorrect reference cosmology are in this casesufficiently accurate. We investigate the degeneracies in the cosmologicalparameters and the benefits of using the two-dimensional anisotropic powerspectrum. Finally, we estimate the uncertainty with which w can be measured byproposed surveys at redshifts of about z=3 and z=1, respectively.  In the simulated survey we find that light-cone effects are small and thatthe simple scaling relations used to correct for the cosmological distortionwork fairly well even for large survey volumes.

Theseclouds have been identified as analogous to the High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs)observed in HI in our Galaxy. Here we compare the distribution of HVCs observedaround our own Galaxy and extra-planar gas around the Andromeda galaxy to thesepossible HVC analogs in a simulation of galaxy formation that naturallygenerates these condensed clouds. We find a very good correspondence betweenthese observations and the simulation, in terms of number, angular size,velocity distribution, overall flux and flux distribution of the clouds. Weshow that condensed cloud accretion only accounts for ~ 0.2 M_solar / year ofthe current overall Galactic accretion in the simulations. We also find thatthe simulated halo clouds accelerate and become more massive as they falltoward the disk. The parameter space of the simulated clouds is consistent withall of the observed HVC complexes that have distance constraints, except theMagellanic Stream which is known to have a different origin. We also find thatnearly half of these simulated halo clouds would be indistinguishable fromlower-velocity gas and that this effect is strongest further from the disk ofthe galaxy, thus indicating a possible missing population of HVCs. Theseresults indicate that the majority of HVCs are consistent with being infalling,condensed clouds that are a remnant of Galaxy formation.",

By comparing the MLCS2k2 fits used in that studyto the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, wedemonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses(after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of acolor gradient across the local sample. If the slope of the linear relation($\\beta$) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then thebubble disappears. If, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely fromMilky Way-like dust, then SN data clearly favors a Hubble bubble.

Wemeasure a spectroscopic period P=1596.4+/-1.2s of the S-wave feature, which issignificantly shorter than the 1611-second periods found in previousphotometric studies. We conclude that the latter period likely represents a`superhump'. If one assumes that our S-wave period is the orbital period, V803Cen's mass ratio can be expected to be much less extreme than previouslythought, at q~0.07 rather than q~0.016. This relaxes the constraints on themasses of the components considerably: the donor star does then not need to befully degenerate, and the mass of the accreting white dwarf no longer has to bevery close to the Chandrasekhar limit.  For HP Lib, we similarly measure a spectroscopic period P=1102.8+/-0.2s. Thissupports the identification of HP Lib's photometric periods found in theliterature, and the constraints upon the masses derived from them.",

This proportionality is explained well by Ando'stheory, in which the linewidth is determined by the electron - vapor atomscattering. However, the linewidth is larger than the calculation by a factorof 2.1. This discrepancy strongly suggests that the theory underestimates theelectron - vapor atom scattering rate. At lower temperatures, the absorptionspectrum splits into several peaks.

In steady state, self-consistency between the two rates of driftrequires that a relationship exists between the coefficients of turbulentviscosity and turbulent resistivity. Ignoring any interactions with a stellarmagnetosphere, we solve the steady-state equations for a magnetized disk underthe gravitational attraction of a mass point and threaded by an amount ofmagnetic flux consistent with calculations of magnetized gravitational collapsein star formation. Our model mean-field equations have an exact analyticalsolution that corresponds to magnetically diluted Keplerian rotation about thecentral mass point. The solution yields the strength of the magnetic field andthe surface density as functions of radial position in the disk and theirconnection with the departure from pure Keplerian rotation in representativecases. We compare the predictions of the theory with the available observationsconcerning T Tauri stars, FU Orionis stars, and low- and high-mass protostars.Finally, we speculate on the physical causes for high and low states of theaccretion disks that surround young stellar objects.

For a linear data model, a number of known andnovel reconstruction schemes, which differ in terms of the underlying signalprior, data likelihood, and numerical inverse extra-regularization schemes arederived and classified. The Bayesian methodology presented in this paper triesto unify and extend the following methods: Wiener-filtering, Tikhonovregularization, Ridge regression, Maximum Entropy, and inverse regularizationtechniques. The inverse techniques considered here are the asymptoticregularization, the Jacobi, Steepest Descent, Newton-Raphson,Landweber-Fridman, and both linear and non-linear Krylov methods based onFletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere, and Hestenes-Stiefel Conjugate Gradients. Thestructures of the up-to-date highest-performing algorithms are presented, basedon an operator scheme, which permits one to exploit the power of fast Fouriertransforms. Using such an implementation of the generalized Wiener-filter inthe novel ARGO-software package, the different numerical schemes arebenchmarked with 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional problems including structured whiteand Poissonian noise, data windowing and blurring effects. A novel numericalKrylov scheme is shown to be superior in terms of performance and fidelity.These fast inverse methods ultimately will enable the application of samplingtechniques to explore complex joint posterior distributions. We outline how thespace of the dark-matter density field, the peculiar velocity field, and thepower spectrum can jointly be investigated by a Gibbs-sampling process. Such amethod can be applied for the redshift distortions correction of the observedgalaxies and for time-reversal reconstructions of the initial density field.",

A rough estimate of the probability to cross such a systemwith a QSO line of sight is P~0.03. The presence of rare neutral transitionssuggests that the cloud is shielded by a large amount of neutral hydrogen. Adetailed comparison of the observed column densities with the averageproperties of damped Ly-alpha systems and local interstellar cold clouds shows,in particular, deficient MgII/MgI and CaII/CaI ratios in our cloud. The resultsof photoionization models indicate that the cloud could be ionized by the UVbackground. However, a simple model of a single cloud with uniform densitycannot reproduce the observed ionic abundance ratios, suggesting a more complexdensity structure for the absorber. Supposing that ionization corrections arenegligible, the most puzzling result is the underabundance of magnesium withrespect to iron which is hard to explain both with nucleosynthesis and withdifferential dust depletion.

It isassumed that the potential binary partners are initially following heliocentricKeplerian orbits and that their relative motion becomes perturbed as theseobjects undergo close encounters. First, the mass, velocity, and orbitalelement distribu- tions which favour binary formation are identified in thecircular and elliptical Hill limits. We then consider intruder scattering inthe circular Hill four-body problem and find that the chaos-assisted capturemechanism is consistent with observed, apparently randomly distributed, binarymutual orbit inclinations. It also predicts asymmetric distributions ofretrograde versus prograde orbits. The time-delay induced by chaos on particletransport through the Hill sphere is analogous to the formation of a resonancein a chemical reaction.

Such isolated galaxy samples have up tonow been small or poorly defined. The AMIGA project (Analysis of theinterstellar Medium of Isolated GAlaxies) represents an attempt to define astatistically useful sample of the most isolated galaxies in the local (z <0.05) Universe. A suitable large sample for the AMIGA project already exists,the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (CIG, Karachentseva 1973; 1050 galaxies),and we use this sample as a starting point to refine and perform a betterquantification of its isolation properties. Digitised POSS-I E images wereanalysed out to a minimum projected radius R > 0.5 Mpc around 950 CIG galaxies(those within Vr = 1500 km s-1 were excluded). We identified all galaxycandidates in each field brighter than B = 17.5 with a high degree ofconfidence using the LMORPHO software. We generated a catalogue ofapproximately 54 000 potential neighbours (redshifts exist for 30% of thissample). Six hundred sixty-six galaxies pass and two hundred eighty-four failthe original CIG isolation criterion. The available redshift data confirm thatour catalogue involves a largely background population rather than physicallyassociated neighbours. We find that the exclusion of neighbours within a factorof four in size around each CIG galaxy, employed in the original isolationcriterion, corresponds to Delta Vr ~ 18000 km s-1 indicating that it was aconservative limit. Galaxies in the CIG have been found to show differentdegrees of isolation. We conclude that a quantitative measure of this ismandatory.

A diagram with the relative location of Fermi levelsand gaps for several oxides is presented. The procedure discussed here isgeneric, allowing for the qualitative prediction of the charge flow directionat several oxide interfaces. The addition of electrons to antiferromagnetic Cuoxides may lead to a superconducting state at the interface with minimalquenched disorder. Model calculations using static and dynamical mean-fieldtheory, supplemented by a Poisson equation formalism to address chargeredistribution at the interface, support this view. The magnetic state of themanganites could be antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic.

We find that these probabilities are strongly dependent on theunderlying cosmology and the efficiency of photon production, but also on thehalo mass. There is a rapid transition between predominantly external andpredominantly internal reionization at a mass scale of 1.0e12 Msun(corresponding roughly to L*galaxies), with haloes less massive than this beingreionized preferentially from distant sources. We provide a fit for thereionization redshift as a function of halo mass, which could be helpful toparameterize reionization in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation oncosmological scales. We find no statistical correlation between thereionization history of field galaxies and their environment.",

We note good agreementbetween the amplitude of the matter power spectrum on intermediate and smallscales as inferred from Ly-alpha forest and lensing data.

This is somewhat larger than the value preferred by the WMAP yearthree CMB data. Combining all three data sets significantly tightens theconstraints on sigma_8, the spectral index of primordial density fluctuationn_s, a possible running of the spectral index n_run and the matter densityOmega_m.

For a few He-weak stars we also estimate theeffective temperatures and the angular diameters by integrating absolute fluxesobserved over a wide spectral range. Non-LTE model calculations are carried outto study the influence of the He/H abundance ratio on the emergent radiation ofHe-strong stars and on their Teff determination. We find that the effectivetemperatures, surface gravities and bolometric absolute magnitudes of He-weakstars estimated with the BCD system and the integrated flux method are in goodagreement between each other, and they also agree with previous determinationsbased on several different methods. The mean discrepancy between the visualabsolute magnitudes derived using the Hipparcos parallaxes and the BCD valuesis on average 0.3 mag for He-weak stars, while it is 0.5 mag for He-strongstars. For He-strong stars, we note that the BCD calibration, based on stars inthe solar environment, leads to overestimated values of Teff. By means of modelatmosphere calculations with enhanced He/H abundance ratios we show that largerHe/H ratios produce smaller BD which naturally explains the Teffoverestimation. We take advantage of these calculations to introduce a methodto estimate the He/H abundance ratio in He-strong stars. The BD of HD 37479suggests that the Teff of this star remains fairly constant as the starspectrum undergoes changes in the intensity of H and He absorption lines.

We emphasize that creation plays very crucial rolein cosmology and provides a natural explanation to the various explosivephenomena occurring in local (z<0.1) and extra galactic universe.

Use of the FKequation of state is limited to physical conditions for which more than 90% ofhelium is ionized. This incudes the inner region of the Sun out to about .98 ofthe solar radius. Despite this limitation, in the parts of the Sun where it isapplicable, the FK equation of state has the power to be more accurate than theequations of state currently used in solar modeling. The FK approach isespecially suited to study physical effects such as Coulomb screening, boundstates, the onset of recombination of fully ionized species, as well asdiffraction and exchange effects.

The case (a) provides a verysimple realization of the phenomenon of condensation which manifests as theappearance of a condensate of particles on the node with maximal degree. Thecase (b) is very interesting since the averaging over typical ensembles ofgraphs acts as a kind of homogenization of the system which makes all nodesidentical from the point of view of the FZRP.

The inner shock of this shell reachesand bounces off the center, leaving behind a central core with an initiallyalmost uniform density distribution, surrounded by an envelope consisting ofthe material in the shock-bounded shell, with a power-law density profile thatat late times approaches a logarithmic slope of -2 even in non-collapsingcases. The resulting density structure resembles a quiescent core of radius <0.1 pc, with a Bonnor-Ebert-like (BE-like) profile, although it has significantdynamical differences: it is initially non-self-gravitating and confined by theram pressure of the infalling material, and consequently, growing continuouslyin mass and size. With the appropriate parameters, the core mass eventuallyreaches an effective Jeans mass, at which time the core begins to collapse.Thus, there is necessarily a time delay between the appearance of the core andthe onset of its collapse, but this is not due to the dissipation of itsinternal turbulence as it is often believed.

The methodguarantees a high accuracy of the spectra with high energy and high momentumresolutions. It takes into account long-range intersite correlations as well asthe strong on-site correlations. Effects of nonlocal excitations are clarifiedby comparing the results with those of the single-site approximation. Thecalculated spectra verify the quantum Monte-Carlo results for finitetemperatures. The spectra at the Fermi level yield a hole-like Fermi surface inthe underdoped region and an electron-like Fermi surface in the overdopedregion. From a numerical analysis of the momentum dependent effective mass andself-energy, it is concluded that a marginal Fermi-liquid like state persistseven at finite doping concentrations in the strongly correlated region becausea van Hove singularity is pinned to the Fermi surface. It is also found that akink structure appears in the quasiparticle energy band in the same region. Thekink is shown to be caused by a mixing between the quasiparticle band and anexcitation band with strong short-range antiferromagnetic correlations. Theseresults suggest an explanation for some of the unusual properties of the normalstate in high-$T_{\\rm c}$ cuprates.",

        "abstract": "It is known that the dependence of the emission-line luminosity of a typicalcloud in the active galactic nuclei broad-line regions (BLRs) upon the incidentflux of ionizing continuum can be nonlinear. We study how this nonlinearity canbe taken into account in estimating the size of the BLR by means of the\"reverberation\" methods. We show that the BLR size estimates obtained bycross-correlation of emission-line and continuum light curves can be much (upto an order of magnitude) less than the values obtained by reverberationmodelling. This is demonstrated by means of numerical cross-correlation andreverberation experiments with model continuum flares and emission-linetransfer functions and by means of practical reverberation modelling of theobserved optical spectral variability of NGC 4151. The time behaviour of NGC4151 in the H_alpha and H_beta lines is modelled on the basis of theobservational data by Kaspi et al. (1996, ApJ, 470, 336) and the theoreticalBLR model by Shevchenko (1984, Sov. Astron. Lett., 10, 377; 1985, Sov. Astron.Lett., 11, 35). The values of the BLR parameters are estimated that allow tojudge on the size and physical characteristics of the BLR. The small size ofthe BLR, as determined by the cross-correlation method from the data of Kaspiet al. (1996, ApJ, 470, 336), is shown to be an artifact of this method. So,the hypothesis that the BLR size varies in time is not necessitated by theobservational data.",

Furthermorethe number of patterns can be huge and a good overview of the structure of thestream is lost quickly. The proposed approach will use clustering to facilitatethe analysis of the structure of the stream.  A clustering on the co-occurrence of patterns will give the user an improvedview on the structure of the stream. Some patterns might occur so much togetherthat they should form a combined pattern. In this way the patterns in theclustering will be the largest frequent patterns: maximal frequent patterns.  Our approach to decide if patterns occur often together will be based on amethod of clustering when only the distance between pairs is known. The numberof maximal frequent patterns is much smaller and combined with clusteringmethods these patterns provide a good view on the structure of the stream.",

For investigating thedynamics in the hydrodynamic limit we derive a system of coupled non-lineardiffusion equations for the coarse-grained particle densities. The relaxationof the initial density profile is analyzed by numerical integration. Exactanalytical expressions are obtained for the self-diffusion coefficients, whichturns out to be length-dependent, and for the stationary solution. In thesteady state we find a discontinuous boundary-induced phase transition as thetotal exterior density gradient between the system boundaries is varied. At oneboundary a boundary layer develops inside which the current flows against thelocal density gradient. Generically the width of the boundary layer and thebulk density profiles do not depend on the two hopping rates.

Lett. {\\bf 97}, 130401 (2006)],a Hamiltonian formulation has been introduced in order to address somelongstanding severe problems associated with the physical description of thedynamical Casimir effect at all times while the mirrors are moving. Here wepresent the complete calculation providing precise details, in particular, ofthe regularization procedure, which is decisive for the correct derivation ofphysically meaningful quantities. A basic difference when comparing with theresults previously obtained by other authors is the fact that the motion forcederived in our approach contains a reactive term --proportional to the mirrors'acceleration. This is of the essence in order to obtain particles with apositive energy all the time during the oscillation of the mirrors --whilealways satisfying the energy conservation law. A careful analysis of theinterrelations among the different results previously obtained in theliterature is then carried out. For simplicity, the specific case of a neutralscalar field in one dimension, with one or two partially transmitting mirrors(a fundamental proviso for the regularization issue) is considered in moredetail, but our general method is shown to be generalizable, without essentialproblems (Sect. 2 of this paper), to fields of any kind in two and higherdimensions.",

In this paper we shall introduce a novel approach tocompute risk functions by using a combination of a highly non-linear processingmodel in conjunction with a powerful information encoding procedure.Specifically, the elements of information either static or dynamic that appearin a road intersection scene are encoded by using directed positional acycliclabeled graphs. The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of aninductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network. Recursiveneural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised andnon-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclicgraphs. The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through wellpredefined scenarios. The major difference of our approach compared to othersis expressed by the fact of learning the structure of the risk. Furthermore,the combination of a rich information encoding procedure with a generalizedmodel of dynamical recurrent networks permit us, as we shall demonstrate, asophisticated processing of information that we believe as being a first stepfor building future advanced intersection safety systems",

The optimal K-band relation islog(M_bh/M_sun) = -0.37(+/-0.04)[M_K +24] + 8.29(+/-0.08), with a total (notintrinsic) scatter in log M_bh equal to 0.33 dex. This level of scatter issimilar to the value of 0.34 dex from the M_bh-sigma relation of Tremaine etal. and compares favourably with the value of 0.31 dex from the M_bh-n relationof Graham & Driver. Using different photometric data, consistent relations inthe B- and R-band are also provided, although we do note that the small (N=13)R-band sample used by Erwin et al. is found here to have a slope of-0.30(+/-0.06) and a total scatter of 0.31 dex. Performing a symmetricalregression on the larger K-band sample gives a slope of -0.40, implying M_bh ~L^{1.00}. Implications for galaxy-black hole coevolution, in terms of drymergers, are briefly discussed, as are predictions for intermediate mass blackholes. Finally, as previously noted by Tundo et al., a potential bias in thegalaxy sample used to define the M_bh-L relations is shown and a correctiveformula provided.",

        "abstract": "We test the theory that lenticular (S0) galaxies form from spirals whose starformation has been shut down. We use the globular cluster specific frequencyS_N, defined as the number of globular clusters normalised by the galaxyluminosity as a diagnostic. NTT/EMMI long-slit spectroscopic observations of 11S0 galaxies at z < 0.006 are used to measure the absorption-line indices,Hdelta, Hgamma, Mgb, Fe5270 and Fe5335 within the central r_e/8. By invertingsingle-stellar population models, luminosity-weighted mean ages, metallicitiesand alpha-element abundance ratios are derived. We estimate the amount offading a galaxy has undergone by comparing each galaxy's S_N with its deviationfrom the mean spiral S_N. Galaxies with higher S_N have older stellarpopulations. Moreover, we find that the zero-point and amount of fading isconsistent with a scenario where lenticulars are formed by the quenching ofstar formation in spiral galaxies. Our data also rule out any formation methodfor S0s which creates a large number of new globular clusters. We confirm thatprevious results showing a relationship between S_N and color are driven by theS_N - Age relation. Five galaxies show detectable Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha or[NII] emission lines. However, only in the two youngest galaxies is thisemission unambiguously from star formation. Our results are consistent with thetheory that S0 galaxies are formed when gas in normal spirals is removed,possibly as a result of a change in environment. The on-going star formation inthe youngest galaxies hints that the timescale of quenching is ~< 1 Gyr. Wespeculate, therefore, that the truncation of star formation is a rather gentleprocess unlikely to involve a rapid burst of star formation.",

Spectral data from the RGS instruments revealseveral strong soft X-ray emission lines, chiefly from hydrogen-like andhelium-like oxygen, nitrogen, neon and carbon. Radiative recombination continua(RRC) from oxygen and carbon are also detected. Our analysis suggests that theemission data are consistent with photoionization. Using the CLOUDYphotoionization code, we found that, while a two-component, high column densitymodel (10e23 cm-2) with low covering factor proved adequate in reproducing alldetected Lyman series lines, it proved insufficient in modeling He-liketriplets observed (neon, oxygen, and nitrogen). If resonance line data wereignored, the two-component model was sufficient to match flux fromintercombination and forbidden lines. However, with the inclusion of resonanceline data, He-like triplets could no longer be modeled with only twocomponents. We found that observed oxygen G and R ratios especially wereanomalous in parameter space investigated. We investigated, and were forced todismiss, the possibility that a third purely collisional component could beresponsible for enhanced resonance line contributions. We succeeded in modelingthe observed spectrum with the addition of a third, lower column density(10e20.5 cm-2) component with non-zero microturbulence and high coveringfactor. While sufficient to reproduce observed soft X-ray flux, our model facescertain shortcomings, particularly in a less-than-ideal visual fit to the lineprofile. Two of the three emission model components bear similarities tocomponents determined by Kraemer et al. (2005) in their study of NGC 4151absorption spectra.",

The mass distribution in the detected clumpsample depends somewhat on assumptions of dust temperature and is not a simple,single power law but contains significant structure at intermediate masses.This structure is likely to be due to crowding of sources near or below thespatial resolution of the observations.

The method is formulated and tested on thetwo-dimensional interior Poisson and exterior Laplace problems, whose solutionsand their normal derivatives are required to be continuous across theinterface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior andexterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values atthe interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used toconstruct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundaryconditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximationsare used to represent both the interior solutions and the boundary values. Astandard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions.The exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of thefree-space Green's function with a surface density; this surface density isitself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution whenthe boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshevapproximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions representsthe external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested bycalculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions ina rectangle. The resulting influence matrix is well-conditioned and solutionsconverge exponentially as the resolution is increased.

Essentially exact basis set expansion techniques are applied todetermine the energy spectrum of systems with N=4 fermions. Fixed-nodediffusion Monte Carlo methods are applied to systems with up to N=20 fermions,and a discussion of different guiding functions used in the Monte Carloapproach to impose the proper symmetry of the fermionic system is presented.The energies are calculated as a function of the s-wave scattering length a_sfor N=2-20 fermions and different mass ratios \\kappa of the two species. On theBEC and BCS sides, our energies agree with analytically-determined first-ordercorrection terms. We extract the scattering length and the effective range ofthe dimer-dimer system up to \\kappa = 20. Our energies for thestrongly-interacting trapped system in the unitarity regime show no shellstructure, and are well described by a simple expression, whose functional formcan be derived using the local density approximation, with one or twoparameters. The universal parameter \\xi for the trapped system for various\\kappa is determined, and comparisons with results for the homogeneous systemare presented.",

This basis makes the geometricinterpretation of the variables transparent: they are the vectors normal to thetriangles within each tetrahedron. We study the condition under which thesestates can be considered semiclassical, and we show that the semiclassical onesdominate the evaluation of quantum correlations. Finally, we describe how theconstraints reducing BF to gravity can be directly written in terms of the newvariables, and how the semiclassicality of the states might improveunderstanding the correct way to implement the constraints.",

Emphasising that complexlens potentials can be constructed from simpler components in linearcombination, we provide a recipe for attaining elliptical symmetry in eitherprojected mass or lens potential. We also provide analytic formulae for thelens potentials of Sersic profiles for integer and half-integer index. We thenpresent formulae describing the gravitational lensing effects due tosmoothly-truncated universal density profiles in cold dark matter model. Forour isolated haloes the density profile falls off as radius to the minus fifthor seventh power beyond the tidal radius, functional forms that allow allorders of lens potential derivatives to be calculated analytically, whileensuring a non-divergent total mass.

A new theoretical approach thatallows one to calculate exactly all dynamic properties of motor proteins, suchas velocity and dispersion, at general conditions is presented. It is foundthat dispersion is a decreasing function of the concentration of bridges, whilethe dependence of dispersion on the burning probability is more complex. Ourcalculations also show a gap in dispersion for very low concentrations of weaklinks which indicates a dynamic phase transition between unbiased and biaseddiffusion regimes.

A simple criterion is developed fordetermining whether the initial photoionized region will be unbounded, whichdepends on the power-law exponent and the ratio of the equivalent Stroemgrenradius produced by the star in a uniform medium to the stellar offset distance.In the expansion stage, the ionized volumes will eventually become unboundedunless pressure balance with the external medium is reached before theionization front velocity becomes supersonic with respect to the ionized gas.",

On average, after they are correctedfor light-curve decline rate, three SNe rise in 18.81 +- 0.36 days, while fiveSNe rise in 16.64 +- 0.21 days. If all eight SNe are sampled from a singleparent population (a hypothesis not favored by statistical tests), the rmsintrinsic scatter of the decline-rate-corrected SN rise time is 0.96 +0.52-0.25 days -- a first measurement of this dispersion. The corresponding globalmean rise time is 17.44 +- 0.39 days, where the uncertainty is dominated byintrinsic variance. This value is ~2 days shorter than two published averagesthat nominally are twice as precise, though also based on small samples.

The most elementary properties, directlyadapted from the case of varieties without orbifold structure, are establishedhere. The arguments of [Ca01] can then be directly adapted to extend the mainstructure results to this orbifold category. We hope to come back to deeperaspects later.

In this study N-body models of 100000 stars with and withoutprimordial binaries are used to investigate the long-term structural evolutionof star clusters. Importantly, the simulation data is analysed using the sameprocesses by which structural parameters are extracted from observed starclusters. This gives a ratio of the core and half-mass (or half-light) radiithat is directly comparable to the Galactic globular cluster sample. As aresult, it is shown that the ratios observed for the bulk of this sample can beexplained without the need for an intermediate-mass black hole.

The major methodological apparatus of the research is a decomposition of thesection bundles where the covariant derivatives of the CKT land via generalizedgradients.

The present modelsfail to explain the high luminosity of Sgr A* a few hundred years ago impliedby Integral observations, but we argue that the accretion of a cold clump witha small impact parameter could have caused it. Finally, we show the possibilityof constraining the total mass-loss rate of the `slow wind stars' using nearinfra-red observations of gas in the central few arcseconds.",

As occurswith the self-consistent Fermi Golden Rule, one condition to obtain thediscontinuous behavior is the proper evaluation of a classical or quantumthermodynamic limit. We show that in presence of an environment, theoscillatory dynamics of a quantum two-level system, in analogy with a classicaldamped oscillator, can undergo a quantum dynamical phase transition to anon-oscillatory phase. This is obtained from a self-consistent solution of theGeneralized Landauer Buettiker Equations, a simplified integral form of theKeldysh formalism. I argue that working at each side of the transition impliesstanding under different paradigms in the Kuhn's sense of the word.

It isin- tended as a study in General Relativity, with emphasis on the coupling tomatter, eventually aimed at a better understanding of very strong gravitationalfields and Black Holes. The work is based on an action principle for thecomplete system of metric and matter fields. We propose a complete revision ofthe treatment of boundary conditions. An ideal star in our terminology hasspherical symmetry and an isentropic equation of state. In our first work onthis subject it was assumed that the density vanishes beyond a finite distancefrom the origin. But it is difficult to decide what the proper boundaryconditions should be and we are consequently skeptical of the concept of afixed boundary. In this paper we investigate the double polytrope,characterized by a polytropic index n less than 5 in the bulk of the star and avalue larger than 5 in an outer atmosphere that extends to infinity. It has nofixed boundary but a region of critical density where the polytropic indexchanges from a value that is appropriate for the bulk of the star to a valuethat provides a crude model for the atmosphere. The existence of a relationbetween mass and radius is confirmed, as well as an upper limit on the mass.The principal conclusion is that all the static configurations are stable.",

After the force isremoved, the system ages with time and its subsequent response time scaleslinearly with its age (simple ageing), meaning that older systems are slowerthan younger ones.

We alsoshow that chemical pollution of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massivestars can result in star-to-star abundance inhomogeneities among light elements(e.g., C, N, and O) of stars in GCs. The present model with a canonical initialmass function (IMF) also shows a C-N anticorrelation that stars with smaller[C/Fe] have larger [N/Fe] in a GC. Although these results imply that``self-pollution'' of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massive stars cancause abundance inhomogeneities of GCs, the present models with differentparameters and canonical IMFs can not show N-rich stars with [N/Fe] ~ 0.8observed in some GCs (e.g., NGC 6752).

This leads to an enhanced overall rateof angular momentum transport and allows accretion of matter to proceed at aninteresting rate. Furthermore, we argue that when vertical transport isimportant, the radial structure of the accretion disk is modified at smallradii and this affects the disk emission spectrum. We present a simple modeldemonstrating how energetic, magnetically-driven outflows modify the emergentdisk emission spectrum with respect to that predicted by standard accretiondisk theory.

It also provides an immediatemicroscopic explanation for Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap region.

Alon,Benjamini, Lubetzky and Sodin studied non-backtracking random walks on regulargraphs, and showed that their mixing rate may be up to twice as fast as that ofthe simple random walk. As an application, they showed that the maximal numberof visits to a vertex, made by a non-backtracking random walk of length $n$ ona high-girth $n$-vertex regular expander, is typically $(1+o(1))\\frac{\\logn}{\\log\\log n}$, as in the case of the balls and bins experiment.

Let $N_t$ denotethe number of vertices visited precisely $t$ times by a non-backtracking randomwalk of length $n$ on a regular $n$-vertex expander of fixed degree and girth$g$. We prove that if $g=\\omega(1)$, then for any fixed $t$, $N_t/n$ istypically $\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{e}t!}+o(1)$.

A pure fluid of hard rectangles may exhibit, aside from the usualuniaxial nematic phase, an additional (tetratic) oriented phase, possessing twodirectors, which is the analogue of the biaxial or cubatic phases in three-dimensional fluids. There is computer simulation evidence that the tetraticphase might be stable with respect to phases with spatial order for rectangleswith low aspect ratios. As hard rectangles are mixed with other particles notpossessing stable tetratic order by themselves, the tetratic phase isdestabilised, via a first- or second-order phase transition, to uniaxialnematic or isotropic phases; for hard rectangles of low aspect ratio tetraticorder persists in a relatively large range of volume fractions. The order ofthese transitions depends on the particle geometry, dimensions andthermodynamic conditions of the mixture. The second component of the mixturehas been chosen to be hard discs or disco-rectangles, the geometry of which isdifferent from that of rectangles, leading to packing frustration and demixingbehaviour, or simply rectangles of different aspect ratio. These mixtures maybe good candidates for observing thermodynamically stable tetratic phases inmonolayers of hard particles. Finally, demixing between fluid(isotropic--tetratic or tetratic--tetratic) phases is seen to occur in mixturesof hard squares of different sizes when the size ratio is sufficiently large.",

It also controls theecliptic latitude at which the Moon crosses the magnetotail and thus the numberand duration of lunar encounters with the plasmasheet. This paper presents adetailed model of those encounters and applies it to the period 1960 to 2030.This shows that the total lunar exposure to the plasmasheet will vary from 10hours per month at a minimum of the eighteen-year cycle rising to 40 hours permonth at the maximum. These variations could have a profound impact on theaccumulation of charge due plasmasheet electrons impacting the lunar surface.Thus we should expect the level of lunar surface charging to vary over theeighteen-year cycle. The literature contains reports that support this: severalobservations made during the cycle maximum of 1994-2000 are attributed tobombardment and charging of the lunar surface by plasmasheet electrons. Thus weconclude that lunar surface charging will vary markedly over an eighteen-yearcycle driven by lunar precession. It is important to interpret lunarenvironment measurements in the context of this cycle and to allow for thecycle when designing equipment for deployment on the lunar surface. This isparticularly important in respect of developing plans for robotic explorationon the lunar surface during the next cycle maximum of 2012-19.",

This review will present an overview of maserpolarization observations and magnetic field determinations of the last severalyears and discuss the implications of the magnetic field measurements forseveral important fields of study, such as aspherical PNe creation and massivestar formation.",

Theone-loop energy is a sum of two contributions, one originating from theHernandez-Lopez phase and another one being due to spin chain finite sizeeffects. We find a result which at the functional level exactly matches theresult of a string theory computation. Expanding the result for large z weobtain the strong coupling limit of the scaling function for low twist, highspin operators of the SL(2) sector of N=4 SYM. In particular we recover thefamous -3 log(2)/\\pi. Its appearance is a result of non-trivial cancellationsbetween the finite size effects and the Hernandez-Lopez correction.",

An analytical expression for the crossover between attractive andrepulsive pressure is obtained as a function of the salt concentration. Thiscondition reduces to the high-salt limit of Parsegian and Gingell where theinteraction is exponentially screened and to the zero salt limit of Lau andPincus in which the important length scales are the inter-plate separation andthe Gouy-Chapman length. In the regime of low salt and high surface charges wepredict - for any ratio of the charges on the surfaces - that the attractivepressure is long-ranged as a function of the spacing. The attractive pressureis related to the decrease in counter-ion concentration as the inter-platedistance is decreased. Our theory predicts several scaling regimes withdifferent scaling expressions for the pressure as function of salinity andsurface charge densities. The pressure predictions can be related to surfaceforce experiments of oppositely charged surfaces that are prepared by coatingone of the mica surfaces with an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte.",

Conventional single-star stellar evolutionary modelscannot explain such stars, but mergers in binary systems have been proposed toexplain their origin.  We have synthesized binary star populations to calculate the number of mergedstars with helium cores which could be early-R stars. We find many possibleevolutionary channels. The most common of which is the merger of a helium whitedwarf with a hydrogen-burning red giant branch star during a common envelopephase followed by a helium flash in a rotating core which mixes carbon to thesurface. All the channels together give ten times more early-R stars than werequire to match recent Hipparcos observations - we discuss which channels arelikely to be the true early-R stars and which are not. For the first time wehave constructed a viable model of the early-R stars with which we can testsome of our ideas regarding common envelope evolution in giants, stellarmergers, rotation, the helium flash and the origin of the early-R stars.",

New accurate approximations for thegrowth of perturbations and the mass function of dark haloes are presented.Structure forms readily in the recollapsing phase of a model with negativeLambda, so collapse fraction alone cannot forbid Lambda from being large andnegative. A negative Lambda is disfavoured only if we assume that formation ofobservers can be neglected once the recollapsing universe has heated to T > 8K. For the case of positive Lambda, however, the current universe does occupy aextremely typical position compared to the predicted distribution on theLambda-T plane. Contrasting conclusions can be reached if anthropic argumentsare applied to the curvature of the universe, and we discuss the falsifiabilityof this mode of anthropic reasoning.",

This process isdual to the zero-range process (ZRP) in the sense that, while for the ZRP therate of transfer of a particle only depends on the occupation of the departuresite, it only depends on the occupation of the arrival site for the targetprocess. More precisely, duality associates to a given ZRP a unique targetprocess, and vice-versa. If the dynamics is symmetric, i.e., in the absence ofa bias, both processes have the same stationary-state product measure. In thiswork we focus our interest on the situation where the latter measure exhibits acontinuous condensation transition at some finite critical density $\\rho_c$,irrespective of the dimensionality. The novelty comes from the case ofasymmetric dynamics, where the target process has a nontrivial fluctuatingstationary state, whose characteristics depend on the dimensionality. In onedimension, the system remains homogeneous at any finite density. An alternatingscenario however prevails in the high-density regime: typical configurationsconsist of long alternating sequences of highly occupied and less occupiedsites. The local density of the latter is equal to $\\rho_c$ and theiroccupation distribution is critical. In dimension two and above, the asymmetrictarget process exhibits a phase transition at a threshold density $\\rho_0$ muchlarger than $\\rho_c$.

We show that the folding pathwaysalong energy gradients organize themselves into scale free networks, thusexplaining previous observations made via molecular dynamics simulations.

In the absence of any correlation of theobserved 360-day periodicity with the standard indicators of stellar activity,the observed radial velocity variations are most plausibly explained in termsof a Keplerian motion of a planetary-mass body around the star. With theestimated stellar mass of 2.3Msun, the minimum mass of the planet is 4.6MJ. Theplanet's orbit is characterized by a mild eccentricity of e=0.17 and asemi-major axis of 1.3 AU. This is the tenth published detection of a planetarycompanion around a red giant star. Such discoveries add to our understanding ofplanet formation around intermediate-mass stars and they provide dynamicalinformation on the evolution of planetary systems around post-main sequencestars.",

The calculations are based onthe exact mapping from the SFG to a ``Lieb-Liniger-Heisenberg'' model withdelta-function repulsions depending on isotropic Heisenberg spin-spininteractions, and indicate that the SFG should be stable against three-bodyrecombination in a large region of the coupling constant plane encompassingparts of both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. However, thelimiting case of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas (FTG), a spin-aligned 1DFermi gas with infinitely attractive p-wave interactions, is unstable in thissense. Effects due to the dipolar interaction and a Zeeman term due to aresonance-generating magnetic field do not lead to shrinkage of the region ofstability of the SFG.",

The first paper reported that PHL 1811 is intrinsically X-rayweak, and presented a spectral energy distribution (SED). Here we present HSTSTIS optical and UV spectra, and ground-based optical spectra. The optical andUV line emission is very unusual. There is no evidence for forbidden orsemiforbidden lines. The near-UV spectrum is dominated by very strong FeII andFeIII, and unusual low-ionization lines such as NaID and CaII H&K are observed.High-ionization lines are very weak; CIV has an equivalent width of 6.6A, afactor of ~5 smaller than measured from quasar composite spectra. An unusualfeature near 1200A can be deblended in terms of Ly\\alpha, NV, SiII, and CIII*using the blueshifted CIV profile as a template. Photoionization modeling showsthat the unusual line emission can be explained qualitatively by the unusuallysoft SED. Principally, a low gas temperature results in inefficient emission ofcollisionally excited lines, including the semiforbidden lines generally usedas density diagnostics. The emission resembles that of high-density gas; inboth cases this is a consequence of inefficient cooling. PHL 1811 is veryunusual, but we note that quasar surveys are generally biased against findingsimilar objects.",

This manipulator is obtained byadding in series to a five-bar planar mechanism (similar to the one studied byBajpai and Roth) a third revolute passing through the line of centers of thetwo actuated revolute joints of the above linkage. The resulting architectureis hybrid in that it has both serial and parallel links. Fully-parallelmanipulators are known for the existence of particularly undesirablesingularities (referred to as parallel singularities) where control is lost [4]and [6]. On the other hand, due to their cantilever type of kinematicarrangement, fully serial manipulators suffer from a lack of stiffness and fromrelatively large positioning errors. The hybrid manipulator studied isintrinsically stiffer and more accurate. Furthermore, since all actuators arelocated on the first axis, the inertial effects are considerably reduced. Inaddition, it is shown that the special kinematic structure of our manipulatorhas the potential of avoiding parallel singularities by a suitable choice ofthe \"working mode\", thus leading to larger workspaces. The influence of thedifferent structural dimensions (e.g. the link lengths) on the kinematic andmechanical properties are analysed in view of the optimal design of such hybridmanipulators.",

For the mid-IR AGN candidates which havemultiwavelength SEDs, we find optical variability for 64% of those classifiedwith SEDs like Broad Line AGNs. While mostly unobscured AGN appear to have themost significant optical variability, some of the more obscured AGNs are alsoobserved as variables.

We have identified 101variable stars of which 60 are new discoveries, doubling the known RR Lyraestars and including 12 SX Phoenicis stars. The average period of the RR Lyraestars (<Pab>=0.662 d, and <Pc>=0.366 d, for fundamental-mode -RRab- andfirst-overtone pulsators, respectively), and the position in theperiod-amplitude diagram both confirm that NGC 2419 is an Oosterhoff IIcluster. The average apparent magnitude of the RR Lyrae stars is <V>=20.31 +/-0.01 (sigma=0.06, 67 stars) and leads to the distance modulus (m-M)o=19.60 +/-0.05. The Color-Magnitude Diagram, reaching about 2.6 mag below the clusterturn-off, does not show clear evidence of multiple stellar populations. Clusterstars are found until r~ 10.5', and possibly as far as r~15', suggesting thatthe literature tidal radius might be underestimated. No extra-tidal structuresare clearly detected in the data.

        "abstract": "The global colors of galaxies have recently been shown to follow bimodaldistributions. Galaxies separate into a ``red sequence'', populatedprototypically by early-type galaxies, and a ``blue cloud'', whose typicalobjects are late-type disk galaxies. Intermediate-type (Sa-Sbc) galaxiespopulate both regions. It has been suggested that this bimodality reflects thetwo-component nature of disk-bulge galaxies. However, it has now beenestablished that there are two types of bulges: ``classical bulges'' that aredynamically hot systems resembling (little) ellipticals, and ``pseudobulges'',dynamically cold, flattened, disk-like structures that could not have formedvia violent relaxation. Therefore thee question is whether at types Sa-Sbc,where both bulge types are found, the red-blue dichotomy separates galaxies atsome value of disk-to-bulge ratio, $B/T$, or, whether it separates galaxies ofdifferent bulge type, irrespective of their $B/T$. We identify classical bulgesand pseudobulges morphologically with HST images in a sample of nearbygalaxies. Detailed surface photometry reveals that: (1) The red -- bluedichotomy is a function of bulge type: at the same $B/T$, pseudobulges are inglobally blue galaxies and classical bulges are in globally red galaxies. (2)Bulge type also predicts where the galaxy lies in other (bimodal) globalstructural parameters. (3) Hence, the red -- blue dichotomy is not due todecreasing bulge prominence alone, and the bulge type of a galaxy carriessignificance for the galaxy's evolutionary history ... (Abridged)",

This uniquestellar system is both one of the oldest (8 Gyr) and most metal-rich ([Fe/H] ~0.4) open clusters in our Galaxy, and has a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) thatexhibits both a red giant clump and a much hotter extreme horizontal branch.Fitting the Balmer lines of the white dwarfs in the cluster, using Keck/LRISspectra, suggests that most of these stars are undermassive, <M> = 0.43 +/-0.06 Msun, and therefore could not have formed from canonical stellar evolutioninvolving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant branch. We show that atleast 40% of NGC 6791's evolved stars must have lost enough mass on the redgiant branch to avoid the flash, and therefore did not convert helium intocarbon-oxygen in their core. Such increased mass loss in the evolution of theprogenitors of these stars is consistent with the presence of the extremehorizontal branch in the CMD. This unique stellar evolutionary channel alsonaturally explains the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 Gyr) for NGC6791 from white dwarf cooling theory; helium core white dwarfs in this clusterwill cool ~3 times slower than carbon-oxygen core stars and therefore thecorrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact ~7 Gyr, consistent with the wellmeasured main-sequence turnoff age.

We report a sensitive upper limit on its radio flux density of 12 uJyat 2 GHz using the NRAO GBT. Timing using XMM and Chandra over a 2.4 yr spanreveals no significant change in its spin period. The 2 sigma upper limit onthe period derivative leads, in the dipole spin-down formalism, to an energyloss rate E-dot < 7e33 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength B_p < 1.5e11 G,and characteristic age tau_c = P/2P-dot > 8 Myr. This tau_c exceeds the age ofthe SNR by 3 orders of magnitude, implying that the pulsar was born spinning atits current period. However, the X-ray luminosity of PSR J1852+0040, L(bol) ~3e33(d/7.1 kpc)^2 ergs/s is a large fraction of E-dot, which challenges therotation-powered assumption. Instead, its high blackbody temperature,0.46+/-0.04 keV, small blackbody radius ~ 0.8 km, and large pulsed fraction, ~80%, may be evidence of accretion onto a polar cap, possibly from a fallbackdisk made of supernova debris. If B_p < 1e10 G, an accretion disk can penetratethe light cylinder and interact with the magnetosphere while resulting torqueson the neutron star remain within the observed limits. A weak B-field is alsoinferred in another CCO, the 424-ms pulsar 1E 1207.4-5209, from its steady spinand soft X-ray absorption lines. We propose this origin of radio-quiet CCOs:the B-field, derived from a turbulent dynamo, is weaker if the NS is formedspinning slowly, which enables it to accrete SN debris. Accretion excludesneutron stars born with both B_p < 1e11 G and P > 0.1 s from radio pulsarsurveys, where B_p < 1e11 G is not encountered except among very old (tau_c >40 Myr) or recycled pulsars.

However, the systematic deformation along the line of sight may bedetectable statistically, either by stacking tomographic 21cm images of quasarsidentified, for example, by JWST, or as small-scale anisotropy in thethree-dimensional 21cm power spectrum. Here we consider the detectability ofthis effect. The anisotropy is largest when HII regions are large and expandrapidly, and we find that if bright quasars contributed to the early stages ofreionization, then they can produce significant anisotropy, on scalescomparable to the typical sizes of HII regions of the bright quasars (approx.30 Mpc and below). The effect therefore cannot be ignored when analyzing future21cm power spectra on small scales. If 10 percent of the volume of the IGM atredshift z=10 is ionized by quasars with typical ionizing luminosity of S= 5 x10^{56} photons/second, the distortions can enhance by more than 10 percent the21cm power spectrum in the radial (redshift) direction, relative to thetransverse directions. The level of this anisotropy exceeds that due toredshift-space distortion, and has the opposite sign. We show that on-goingexperiments such as MWA should be able to detect this effect. A detection wouldreveal the presence of bright quasars, and shed light on the ionizing yield andage of the ionizing sources, and the distribution and small-scale clumping ofneutral intergalactic gas in their vicinity.",

        "abstract": "Star formation happens in a clustered way which is why the star clusterpopulation of a particular galaxy is closely related to the star formationhistory of this galaxy. From the probabilistic nature of a mass functionfollows that the mass of the most-massive cluster of a complete population,M_max, has a distribution with the total mass of the population as a parameter.The total mass of the population is connected to the star formation rate (SFR)by the length of a formation epoch.  Since due to evolutionary effects only massive star clusters are observableup to high ages it is convenient to use this M_max(SFR) relation for thereconstruction of a star formation history. The age-distribution of themost-massive clusters can therefore be used to constrain the star formationhistory of a galaxy. The method, including an assessment of the inherentuncertainties, is introduced with this contribution, while following paperswill apply this method to a number of galaxies.",

By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipseeach other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of thedaysides of these planets. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able totransport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which willdetermine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here wereport observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetarysystems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' ofthe distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as thedayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightnesstemperature of 973 +/- 33 K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1212 +/- 11K at a wavelength of 8 microns, indicating that energy from the irradiateddayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast toa recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peakhemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16$\\pm$6 degrees before opposition,corresponding to a hot spot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondaryeclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120 +/- 24 s later thanpredicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.",

However, in order to connect theseconditions with observations, one often needs first to integrate them, and thenfind the corresponding constraints on some observational variables, such as thedistance modulus. Those integral forms can be misleading, and great caution isneeded when one interprets them physically. A typical example is that thetransition point of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ is at about $z \\simeq0.76$ in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. However, with the same model when we considerthe dimensionless Hubble parameter $E(z)$, which involves the integration of$q(z)$, we find that $E(z)$ does not cross the line of $q(z) = 0$ before $z =2$. Therefore, to get the correct result, we cannot use the latter to determinethe transition point. With these in mind, we carefully study the constraintsfrom the energy conditions, and find that, among other things, the currentobservational data indeed strongly indicate that our universe has ocneexperienced an accelerating expansion phase between the epoch of galaxyformation and the present.",

Further observations using {\\em  Swift}, Gemini-North, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory refined the sourceposition and confirmed the absence of any optical counterpart to an X-ray tooptical flux ratio of F_X/F_V > 8700 (3 sigma). Interpretation of 1RXSJ141256.0+792204 -- which we have dubbed Calvera -- as a typical X-ray-dimisolated neutron star would place it at z ~ 5.1 kpc above the Galactic disk --in the Galactic halo -- implying that it either has an extreme space velocity(v_z >~ 5100 km s-1) or has failed to cool according to theoreticalpredictions. Interpretations as a persistent anomalous X-ray pulsar, or a``compact central object'' present conflicts with these classes' typicalproperties. We conclude the properties of Calvera are most consistent withthose of a nearby (80 to 260 pc) radio pulsar, similar to the radio millisecondpulsars of 47 Tuc, with further observations required to confirm thisclassification. If it is a millisecond pulsar, it has an X-ray flux equal tothe X-ray brightest millisecond pulsar (and so is tied for highest flux); isthe closest northern hemisphere millisecond pulsar; and is potentially theclosest known millisecond pulsar in the sky, making it an interesting targetfor X-ray-study, a radio pulsar timing array, and LIGO.",

Thispaper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigabilityin a growing knowledge space.

For most of these afterglows, the X-ray spectral slope and the decayindices before and after the break can be accommodated by the standard jetmodel although a different origin of the breaks cannot be ruled out. Inaddition, there are 27 other afterglows whose X-ray light-curves may alsoexhibit a late break to a steep decay, but the evidence is not that compelling.  The X-ray emissions of 38 afterglows decay slower than t^{-1.5} until after 3day, half of them exhibiting such a slow decay until after 10 day.  Therefore, the fraction of well-monitored Swift afterglows with potentialjet-breaks is around 60 percent, whether we count only the strongest cases foreach type or all of them. This fraction is comparable to the 75 percent ofpre-Swift afterglows whose optical light-curves displayed similar breaks at ~1day.  The properties of the prompt emission of Swift afterglows with light-curvebreaks show the same correlations (peak energy of GRB spectrum with the burstisotropic output and with burst collimated output) as previously found forpre-Swift optical afterglows with light-curve breaks (the Amati and Ghirlandarelations, respectively).

The Hausdorffdistance between the Ritz values, corresponding to different trial subspaces,is shown to be bounded by a constant times the gap between the trial subspaces.We prove a similar eigenvalue perturbation bound that involves the gap squared.Finally, we consider the classical alternating projectors method and proposeits ultimate acceleration, using the conjugate gradient approach.

In one important meshprimitive, called a mesh update, each mesh vertex stores a value and repeatedlyupdates this value based on the values stored in all neighboring vertices. Theperformance of a mesh update depends on the layout of the mesh in memory.  This paper shows how to find a memory layout that guarantees that the meshupdate has asymptotically optimal memory performance for any set of memoryparameters. Such a memory layout is called cache-oblivious. Formally, for a$d$-dimensional mesh $G$, block size $B$, and cache size $M$ (where$M=\\Omega(B^d)$), the mesh update of $G$ uses $O(1+|G|/B)$ memory transfers.The paper also shows how the mesh-update performance degrades for smallercaches, where $M=o(B^d)$.  The paper then gives two algorithms for finding cache-oblivious mesh layouts.The first layout algorithm runs in time $O(|G|\\log^2|G|)$ both in expectationand with high probability on a RAM. It uses $O(1+|G|\\log^2(|G|/M)/B)$ memorytransfers in expectation and $O(1+(|G|/B)(\\log^2(|G|/M) + \\log|G|))$ memorytransfers with high probability in the cache-oblivious and disk-access machine(DAM) models.

        "abstract": "The bright X-ray transient H 1743-322 was observed daily by the Rossi X-rayTiming Explorer (RXTE) during most of its 8-month outburst in 2003. We presenta detailed spectral analysis and a supporting timing analysis of all of thesedata, and we discuss the behavior and evolution of the source in terms of thethree principal X-ray states defined by Remillard and McClintock. These X-rayresults are complemented by Very Large Array (VLA) data obtained at sixfrequencies that provide quite complete coverage of the entire outburst cycleat 4.860 GHz and 8.460 GHz. We also present photometric data and finding chartsfor the optical counterpart in both outburst and quiescence. We closely compareH 1743-322 to the well-studied black-hole X-ray transient XTE J1550-564 andfind the behaviors of these systems to be very similar. As reported elsewhere,both H 1743-322 and XTE J1550-564 are relativistic jet sources and both exhibita pair of high-frequency QPO oscillations with a 3:2 frequency ratio. The manystriking similarities between these two sources argue strongly that H 1743-322is a black hole binary, although presently no dynamical data exist to supportthis conclusion.",

This transmissionprovides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinionsand linear drives. The pressure angle is a suitable performance index for thistransmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the loadvs. that transmitted to the machine frame. Two alternative design strategiesare studied, namely, (i) increase the number of lobes on each cam or (ii)increase the number of cams.

        "abstract": "Most industrial machine tools have a serial kinematic architecture, whichmeans that each axis has to carry the following one, including its actuatorsand joints. High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of sucharchitectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure highstiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limitthe dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more andmore researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer severaladvantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity andhigh dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of thelinks provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertiaeffects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of aparallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires furtherresearch studies before wide industrial use can be expected. Many criteria needto be taken into account in the design of a PKMT. We pay special attention tothe description of kinetostatic criteria that rely on the conditioning of theJacobian matrix of the mechanism. The organisation of this paper is as follows:next section introduces general remarks about PKMs, then is explained why PKMscan be interesting alternative machine tool designs. Then are presentedexisting PKMTs. An application to the design of a small-scale machine toolprototype developed at IRCCyN is presented at the end of this paper.",

Starting froma conventional energy functional we calculate the low-lying collectivevibrations in Relativistic Random Phase Approximation (RRPA) and construct anenergy dependent self-energy for the Dyson equation. The resultingBethe-Salpeter equation in the particle-hole ($ph$) channel is solved in theTime Blocking Approximation (TBA). No additional parameters are used and doublecounting is avoided by a proper subtraction method. The same energy functional,i.e. the same set of coupling constants, generates the Dirac-Hartreesingle-particle spectrum, the static part of the residual $ph$-interaction andthe particle-phonon coupling vertices. Therefore a fully consistent descriptionof nuclear excited states is developed. This method is applied for aninvestigation of damping phenomena in the spherical nuclei with closed shells$^{208}$Pb and $^{132}$Sn.

Two conjectures, an additional rotation in the fourth curled-updimension and the weight factors on the eigenvectors, are proposed to serve asa boundary condition to deal with the topologic problem of the 3D Ising model.The partition function of the 3D simple orthorhombic Ising model is evaluatedby spinor analysis, by employing these conjectures. Based on the validity ofthe conjectures, the critical temperature of the simple orthorhombic Isinglattices could be determined by the relation of KK* = KK' + KK'' + K'K'' orsinh 2K sinh 2(K' + K'' + K'K''/K) = 1. For a simple cubic Ising lattice, thecritical point is putatively determined to locate exactly at the golden ratioxc = exp(-2Kc) = (sq(5) - 1)/2, as derived from K* = 3K or sinh 2K sinh 6K = 1.If the conjectures would be true, the specific heat of the simple orthorhombicIsing system would show a logarithmic singularity at the critical point of thephase transition. The spontaneous magnetization and the spin correlationfunctions of the simple orthorhombic Ising ferromagnet are derived explicitly.The putative critical exponents derived explicitly for the simple orthorhombicIsing lattices are alpha = 0, beta = 3/8, gamma = 5/4, delta = 13/3, eta = 1/8and nu = 2/3, showing the universality behavior and satisfying the scalinglaws. The cooperative phenomena near the critical point are studied and theresults obtained based on the conjectures are compared with those of theapproximation methods and the experimental findings.

Here wepresent such an analysis using the photometric transit timing variation($TTV_p$). We examined the light curve effects of both the transiting planetand its satellite. We define the photometric central time of the transit thatis equivalent to the transit of a fixed photocenter. This point orbits thebarycenter, and leads to the photometric transit timing variations. The exactvalue of $TTV_p$ depends on the ratio of the density, the mass, and the size ofthe satellite and the planet. Since two of those parameters are independent, areliable estimation of the density ratio leads to an estimation of the size andthe mass of the exomoon. Upper estimations of the parameters are possible inthe case when an upper limit of $TTV_p$ is known. In case the density ratiocannot be estimated reliably, we propose an approximation with assuming equaldensities. The presented photocenter $TTV_p$ analysis predicts the size of thesatellite better than the mass. We simulated transits of the Earth-Moon systemin front of the Sun. The estimated size and mass of the Moon are 0.020Earth-mass and 0.274 Earth-size if equal densities are assumed. This result iscomparable to the real values within a factor of 2. If we include the realdensity ratio (about 0.6), the results are 0.010 Earth-Mass and 0.253Earth-size, which agree with the real values within 20%.",

We find that unstable modes arise for velocity of the jetlarger than the speed of the sound of the plasma and only modes with momentasmaller than a certain values are unstable.

The derivation is confirmed in the database consistently.  This static procedure is applied to a quasi-static system.

We find that this assumption is insufficient to model theexperimentally observed shapes and packing of the cells based on their cadherinexpression. We then consider a model in which adhesion leads to a surfaceincrease, balanced by cell cortex contraction.

Apart from detailing the cosmicgeometry, this would allow us to verify and quantify homogeneity, rather thanassuming it, as has been necessary up to now, and to do that on a metric level,and not merely at the mass distribution level. This paper is the beginning of aproject aimed at such a numerical implementation. The primary observationaldata from our past light cone consists of galaxy redshifts, apparentluminosities, angular diameters and number densities, together with sourceevolution functions, absolute luminosities, true diameters and masses ofsources. Here we start with the simplest case, that of spherical symmetry and adust equation of state, and execute an algorithm that determines the unknownmetric functions from this data. We discuss the challenges of turning thetheoretical algorithm into a workable numerical procedure, particularlyaddressing the origin and the maximum in the area distance. Our numericalmethod is tested with several artificial data sets for homogeneous andinhomogeneous models, successfully reproducing the original models. Thisdemonstrates the basic viability of such a scheme.

In order toinvestigate this phenomenon we present a simple hybrid cellular automaton modelof cell colony growth. In the model the growth of the colony is limited by anutrient that is consumed by the cells and which inhibits cell division if itfalls below a certain threshold. Using this model we have investigated how thenutrient consumption rate of the cells affects the growth dynamics of thecolony. We found that for low consumption rates the colony takes on a Eden-likemorphology, while for higher consumption rates the morphology of the colony isbranched with a fractal geometry. These findings are in agreement with previousresults, but the simplicity of the model presented here allows for a linearstability analysis of the system. By observing that the local growth of thecolony is proportional to the flux of the nutrient we derive an approximatedispersion relation for the growth of the colony interface. This dispersionrelation shows that the stability of the growth depends on how far the nutrientpenetrates into the colony. For low nutrient consumption rates the penetrationdistance is large, which stabilises the growth, while for high consumptionrates the penetration distance is small, which leads to unstable branchedgrowth. When the penetration distance vanishes the dispersion relation isreduced to the one describing Laplacian growth without ultra-violetregularisation. The dispersion relation was verified by measuring how theaverage branch width depends on the consumption rate of the cells and showsgood agreement between theory and simulations.",

        "abstract": "We study the effects of different forms of information feedback associatedwith mass media on an agent-agent based model of the dynamics of culturaldissemination. In addition to some processes previously considered, we alsoexamine a model of local mass media influence in cultural dynamics. Twomechanisms of information feedback are investigated: (i) direct mass mediainfluence, where local or global mass media act as an additional element in thenetwork of interactions of each agent, and (ii) indirect mass media influence,where global media acts as a filter of the influence of the existing network ofinteractions of each agent. Our results generalize previous findings showingthat cultural diversity builds-up by increasing the strength of the mass mediainfluence. We find that this occurs independently of the mechanisms of action(direct or indirect) of the mass media message. However, through an analysis ofthe full range of parameters measuring cultural diversity, we establish thatthe enhancement of cultural diversity produced by interaction with mass mediaonly occurs for strong enough mass media messages. In comparison with previousstudies a main different result is that weak mass media messages, incombination with agent-agent interaction, are efficient in producing culturalhomogeneity. Moreover, the homogenizing effect of weak mass media messages aremore efficient for direct local mass media messages than for global mass mediamessages or indirect global mass media influences.",

An overview of the method is presented beforediscussing the effect of magnetic fields on the formation of circumstellardiscs around young stars. We find that the presence of magnetic fields duringthe disc formation process can lead to significantly smaller and less massivediscs which are much less prone to gravitational instability. Similarly in thecase of binary star formation we find that magnetic fields, overall, suppressfragmentation. However these effects are found to be largely driven by magneticpressure. The relative importance of magnetic tension is dependent on theorientation of the field with respect to the rotation axis, but can, with theright orientation, lead to a dilution of the magnetic pressure-drivensuppression of fragmentation.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of magnetic flux from the convection zone into the corona is animportant process for the dynamical evolution of the coronal magnetic field. Inthis paper we extend our previous numerical investigations, by looking at theprocess of flux interaction as an initially twisted flux tube emerges into aplane parallel, coronal magnetic field. Significant differences are found inthe dynamical appearance and evolution of the emergence process depending onthe relative orientation between the rising flux system and any preexistingcoronal field. When the flux systems are nearly anti-parallel, the experimentsshow substantial reconnection and demonstrate clear signatures of a hightemperature plasma located in the high velocity outflow regions extending fromthe reconnection region. However, the cases that have a more parallelorientation of the flux systems show very limited reconnection and none of theassociated features. Despite the very different amount of reconnection betweenthe two flux systems, it is found that the emerging flux that is stillconnected to the original tube, reaches the same height as a function of time.As a compensation for the loss of tube flux, a clear difference is found in theextent of the emerging loop in the direction perpendicular to the main axis ofthe initial flux tube. Increasing amounts of magnetic reconnection decrease thevolume, which confines the remaining tube flux.",

It is derived from the FFT of acceleration andcorrection is made for the transfer function of the instrument that generatedthe data. As with any such spectrum of density (`per Hz') type, the noiseinherent to a PSD is large. This article illustrates the value of a functionthat is derived from the PSD and for which the influence of noise issignificantly reduced. Called the cumulative spectral power (CSP), it isobtained from the PSD through the noise-reducing process of integration. Themaximum of the CSP (corresponding to the longest graphed value of the period)provides a means for estimating the total vibrational power of the earth. Thepresent author has significantly simplified the process of PSD generation. Thusroutine graphing is straightforwared-of first the FFT, followed by thegeneration of both a PSD and its associated CSP.

        "abstract": "The postburst object of a GRB is likely to be a highly magnetized, rapidlyrotating compact object (e.g., a millisecond magnetar), which could produce anultrarelativistic electron-positron-pair wind. The interaction of such a windwith an outwardly expanding fireball ejected during the burst leads to arelativistic wind bubble (RWB). We numerically calculate the dynamics andradiative properties of RWBs and use this model to explain the shallow decayphase of the early X-ray afterglows observed by Swift. We find that RWBs canfall into two types: forward-shock-dominated and reverse-shock-dominatedbubbles. Their radiation during a period of $\\sim 10^{2}-10^{5}$ seconds isdominated by the shocked medium and the shocked wind, respectively, based ondifferent magnetic energy fractions of the shocked materials. For both types,the resulting light curves always have a shallow decay phase. In addition, weprovide an example fit to the X-ray afterglows of GRB 060813 and GRB 060814 andshow that they could be produced by forward-shock-dominated andreverse-shock-dominated bubbles, respectively. This implies that, for someearly afterglows (e.g., GRB 060814), the long-lasting reverse shock emission isstrong enough to explain their shallow decay phase.",

        "abstract": "The monotonicity and stability of difference schemes for, in general,hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with source terms are studied. Thebasic approach is to investigate the stability and monotonicity of a non-linearscheme in terms of its corresponding scheme in variations. Such an approachleads to application of the stability theory for linear equation systems toestablish stability of the corresponding non-linear scheme. The mainmethodological innovation is the theorems establishing the notion that anon-linear scheme is stable (and monotone) if the corresponding scheme invariations is stable (and, respectively, monotone). Criteria are developed formonotonicity and stability of difference schemes associated with the numericalanalysis of systems of partial differential equations. The theorem ofFriedrichs (1954) is generalized to be applicable to variational schemes withnon-symmetric matrices. A new modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF)scheme is developed to be of the second order accuracy. A monotone piecewisecubic interpolation is used in the central schemes to give an accurateapproximation for the model in question. The stability and monotonicity of themodified scheme are investigated. Some versions of the modified scheme aretested on several conservation laws, and the scheme is found to be accurate androbust. As applied to hyperbolic conservation laws with, in general, stiffsource terms, it is constructed a second order scheme based onoperator-splitting techniques.",

If thenumber of non-occurrences between two occurrences of a pattern stays almost thesame then we call the pattern balanced.  It was noticed that some very frequent patterns obviously also occur with abalanced interval, meaning in every transaction. However more interestingpatterns might occur, e.g., every three transactions. Here we discuss asolution using standard deviation and average.

Also two-component bottle brush polymers are considered, where two types(A,B) of side chains are grafted, assuming that monomers of different kindrepel each other. In this case, variable solvent quality is allowed for, suchthat for poor solvent conditions rather dense cylinder-like structures result.Theories predict ``Janus Cylinder''-type phase separation along the backbone inthis case. The Monte Carlo simulations, using the pruned-enriched Rosenbluthmethod (PERM) then are restricted to rather short side chain length.Nevertheless, evidence is obtained that the phase separation between an A-richpart of the cylindrical molecule and a B-rich part can only occur locally. Thecorrelation length of this microphase separation can be controlled by thesolvent quality.

Our CCD-based data are not significantly different than values obtainedat Cerro Paranal. We find that the yearly averages of V-band sky brightness arebest correlated with the 10.7-cm solar flux taken 5 days prior to the skybrightness measures. This implies an average speed of 350 km/sec for the solarwind. While we can measure an enhancement of the night sky levels over LaSerena 10 degrees above the horizon, at elevation angles above 45 degrees wefind no evidence that the night sky brightness at Cerro Tololo is affected byartificial light of nearby towns and cities.",

This agreement requires that thegalactic halo be of sufficient extent to maintain the galaxy at high curvaturein the presence of the low-curvature cosmological background. If the galactichalo and local environment in f(R) models do not have substantially deeperpotentials than expected in LCDM, then cosmological field amplitudes |f_R| >10^{-6} will cause the galactic interior to evolve to low curvature during theacceleration epoch. Viability of large-deviation models therefore rests on thestructure and evolution of the galactic halo, requiring cosmologicalsimulations of f(R) models, and not directly on solar-system tests. Even smalldeviations that conservatively satisfy both galactic and solar-systemconstraints can still be tested by future, percent-level measurements of thelinear power spectrum, while they remain undetectable to cosmological-distancemeasures.

The likelihood for this outcome increases as the mergerprogresses, and there is a remote possibility that our Sun will be more tightlybound to Andromeda than to the Milky Way before the final merger. Eventually,after the merger has completed, the Sun is most likely to be scattered to theouter halo and reside at much larger radii (>30 kpc).

        "abstract": "Recently, several powerful tools for the reconstruction of stochasticdifferential equations from measured data sets have been proposed [e.g. Siegertet al., Physics Letters A 243, 275 (1998); Hurn et al., Journal of Time SeriesAnalysis 24, 45 (2003)]. Efficient application of the methods, however,generally requires Markov properties to be fulfilled. This constraint typicallyseems to be violated on small scales, which frequently is attributed tophysical effects. On the other hand, measurement noise such as uncorrelatedmeasurement and discretization errors has large impacts on the statistics ofmeasurements on small scales. We demonstrate, that the presence of measurementnoise, likewise, spoils Markov properties of an underlying Markov processes.This fact is promising for the further development of techniques for thereconstruction of stochastic processes from measured data, since limitations atsmall scales might stem from artificial noise sources rather than fromintrinsic properties of the dynamics of the underlying process. Measurementnoise, however, can be controlled much better than the intrinsic dynamics ofthe underlying process.",

Under such conditions, in this paper we investigate howto maximize the spectral efficiency in the secondary system. A secondaryreceiver observes a multiple access channel of two users, the secondary and theprimary transmitter, respectively. We show that, for spectrally-efficientoperation, the secondary system should apply Opportunistic InterferenceCancellation (OIC). With OIC, the secondary system decodes the primary signalwhen such an opportunity is created by the primary rate and the power receivedfrom the primary system. For such an operation, we derive the achievable datarate in the secondary system. When the primary signal is decodable, we devise amethod, based on superposition coding, by which the secondary system canachieve the maximal possible rate. Finally, we investigate the power allocationin the secondary system when multiple channels are used. We show that theoptimal power allocation with OIC can be achieved through interceptedwater-filling instead of the conventional water-filling. The results show asignificant gain for the rate achieved through an opportunistic interferencecancellation.",

Its eruption resembled thewell-known FU Orionis-type or EX Lupi-type outbursts. Since very few suchevents have ever been documented at infrared wavelengths, our aim is to studythe temporal evolution of OO Ser in the infrared. OO Ser was monitored with theInfrared Space Observatory starting 4 months after peak brightness and covering20 months. In 2004-2006 we again observed OO Ser from the ground andcomplemented this dataset with archival Spitzer obsevations also from 2004. Weanalysed these data with special attention to source confusion and constructedlight curves at 10 different wavelengths as well as spectral energydistributions. The outburst caused brightening in the whole infrared regime.According to the infrared light curves, OO Ser started a wavelength-independentfading after peak brightness. Later the flux decay became slower but stayedwavelength-independent. The fading is still ongoing, and current fading ratesindicate that OO Ser will not return to quiescent state before 2011. Theoutburst timescale of OO Ser seems to be shorter than that of FUors, but longerthan that of EXors. The outburst timescale and the moderate luminosity suggestthat OO Ser is different from both FUors and EXors, and shows similarities tothe recently erupted young star V1647 Ori. Based on its spectral energydistribution and bolometric temperature, OO Ser seems to be an early class Iobject, with an age of < 10^5 yr. The object is probably surrounded by anaccretion disc and a dense envelope. Due to the shorter outburst timescales,the viscosity in the circumstellar disc of OO Ser is probably an order ofmagnitude higher than usual for FUors.",

We reveal a magnetoresistance effect that ispronounced. In our trilayers the magnetoresistance exhibits an increase of twoorders of magnitude when the superconducting state is reached: from theconventional normal-state values 0.6 % it goes up to 1000 % for temperaturesbelow Tc. In contrast, in the bilayers the effect is only minor since from 3%in the normal state increases only to 70 % for temperatures below Tc.Magnetization data of both the longitudinal and transverse magnetic componentsare presented. Most importantly, we present data not only for the normal stateof Nb but also in its superconducting state. Strikingly, these data show thatbelow its Tc SC the Nb interlayer under the influence of the outer Ni80Fe20layers attains a magnetization component transverse to the external field. Bycomparing the transport and magnetization data we propose a candidate mechanismthat could motivate the pronounced magnetoresistance effect observed in thetrilayers. Adequate magnetostatic coupling of the outer Ni80Fe20 layers ismotivated by stray fields that emerge naturally in their whole surface due tothe multidomain magnetic structure that they attain near coercivity. Atomicforce microscopy is employed in order to examine the possibility that suchmagnetostatic coupling could be promoted by interface roughness. Referring tothe bilayers, although out-of-plane rotation of the magnetization of the singleNi80Fe20 layer is still observed, in these structures magnetostatic couplingdoes not occur due to the absence of a second Ni80Fe20 one so that the observedmagnetoresistance peaks are only modest.",

To this end, we use dataavailable in the literature and our own measurements of the cosmic fluxdecrement for 25 quasars in the redshift range 2.71 < z < 5.41 taken from theSDSS Data Release 5. In order to perform the measurements of D_A, we fit apower-law to the continuum redward of the Lya emission line, and extrapolatethis fit to region blueward of it, where the flux is severely affected byabsorption due to intervening HI absorbers. We compute, using numericalsimulations, the redshift evolution of D_A accounting for the presence of LyaForest absorbers and Lyman limit systems randomly distributed along theline-of-sight, and compute its intrinsic scatter at the 1-, 2-, and 3-sigmalevel due to fluctuations in the absorber properties (column density, Dopplerparameter, redshift) along different lines-of-sight. The numerical simulationsconsist of Monte Carlo realizations of distributions of the absorber propertiesconstrained from observations. The results from the models considered hereconfirm our theoretical expectation that the distribution of D_A at any givenredshift be well described by a lognormal distribution function. This impliesthat the effective optical depth, usually defined as the negative logarithm ofthe average flux, 1 - D_A, is very accurately Gaussian distributed, in contrastto previous studies. This result is independent to the form of the inputdistribution functions, and rather insensitive to the presence of high-columndensity absorbers, such as the Lyman limit systems.",

We rely mainly on an approach developed by the authors based on thestudy of dynamical large fluctuations in stationary states of open systems. Theoutcome of this approach is a theory connecting the non equilibriumthermodynamics to the transport coefficients via a variational principle. Thisleads ultimately to a functional derivative equation of Hamilton-Jacobi typefor the non equilibrium free energy in which local thermodynamic variables arethe independent arguments.

        "abstract": "We have combined multi-wavelength observations of a selected sample ofstarforming galaxies with galaxy evolution models in order to compare theresults obtained for different SFR tracers and to study the effect that theevolution of the starforming regions has on them. We also aimed at obtaining abetter understanding of the corrections due to extinction and nuclear activityon the derivation of the SFR. We selected the sample from Chandra data for thewell studied region Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and chose the objects thatalso have UV and IR data from GALEX and GOODS-Spitzer respectively.  Our main finding is that there is good agreement between the extinctioncorrected SFR(UV) and the SFR(X), and we confirm the use of X-ray luminositiesas a trustful tracer of recent star formation activity. Nevertheless, atSFR(UV) larger than about 5Msol/year there are several galaxies with an excessof SFR(X) suggesting the presence of an obscured AGN not detected in theoptical spectra. We conclude that the IR luminosity is driven by recent starformation even in those galaxies where the SFR(X) is an order of magnitudehigher than the SFR(UV) and therefore may harbour an AGN. One object showsSFR(X) much lower than expected based on the SFR(UV); this SFR(X) `deficit' maybe due to an early transient phase before most of the massive X-ray binarieswere formed. An X-ray deficit could be used to select extremely young bursts inan early phase just after the explosion of the first supernovae associated withmassive stars and before the onset of massive X-ray binaries.",

Its principles rely on Boltzmann samplers, as recentlydeveloped by Duchon, Flajolet, Louchard, and Schaeffer. It combines theBoltzmann framework, a suitable use of rejection, a new combinatorial bijectionfound by Fusy, Poulalhon and Schaeffer, as well as a precise analyticdescription of the generating functions counting planar graphs, which wasrecently obtained by Gim\\'enez and Noy. This gives rise to an extremelyefficient algorithm for the random generation of planar graphs. There is apreprocessing step of some fixed small cost. Then, the expected time complexityof generation is quadratic for exact-size uniform sampling and linear forapproximate-size sampling. This greatly improves on the best previously knowntime complexity for exact-size uniform sampling of planar graphs with $n$vertices, which was a little over $O(n^7)$.",

        "abstract": "The paper offers a discrete thermodynamic model of lasers. Laser is an opensystem; its equilibrium is based on a balance of two thermodynamic forces, onerelated to the incoming pumping power and another to the emitted light. Thebasic expression for such equilibrium is a logistic map, graphical solutions towhich are pitchfork bifurcation diagrams. As pumping force increases, therelative populations on the ground and lasing branches tend to zero and unitycorrespondingly. An interesting feature of this model is the line spectrum ofthe up and down transitions between the branches beyond bifurcation point. Evenin a simple case of 2-level laser with only 2 possible transition types (up anddown), the spectra look like sets of the line packets, starting well before thepopulation inversion. This effect is an independent confirmation of theEinstein's prohibition on practical realization of 2-level laser. Multilevellasers may be approached by employing the idea of thermodynamic activity forthe emitting atoms. Considering coefficient of thermodynamic activity of thelasing level atoms to be proportional to the ratio of life times on the upperand lasing (the 3d) levels, one can derive a new basic map for the multilevellaser system. For a modest ratio only of 0.01, spontaneous transitions betweenlevels are pushed to the area beyond population inversion, opening a space forthe functioning of laser.",

UsingFar-Infrared emission data, we show that the large scatter seen in previousstudies of lambda_max as a function of A_V is primarily due to line of sighteffects causing some A_V measurements to not be a good tracer of the extinction(radiation field strength) seen by the grains being probed. The derived slopesin lambda_max vs. A_V, for the individual clouds, are consistent with a commonvalue, while the zero intercepts scale with the average values of the ratios oftotal-to-selective extinction (R_V) for the individual clouds. Within eachcloud we do not find direct correlations between lambda_max and R_V. Thepositive slope in consistent with recent developments in theory and indicatingalignment driven by the radiation field. The present data cannot conclusivelydifferentiate between direct radiative torques and alignment driven by H_2formation. However, the small values of lambda_max(A_V=0), seen in severalclouds, suggest a role for the latter, at least at the cloud surfaces. Thescatter in the lambda_max vs. A_V relation is found to be associated with thecharacteristics of the embedded Young Stellar Objects (YSO) in the clouds.

Ourmodel assumes an additional Yukawa-like term with two parameters thatcharacterize the amplitude and the length scale of the modified gravity. Themodel predictions are calculated using two methods; the second-orderperturbation theory and direct N-body simulations. These methods allow us tostudy non-linear evolution of large-scale structure. Using the simulationresults, we find that perturbation theory provides reliable estimates for thepower spectrum and the bispectrum in the modified Newtonian model. We alsoconstruct mock galaxy catalogues from the simulations, and derive constraintson the amplitude and the length scale of deviations from Newtonian gravity. Theresulting constraints from power spectrum are consistent with those obtained inour earlier work, indicating the validity of the previous empirical modeling ofgravitational nonlinearity in the modified Newtonian model. If linear biasingis adopted, the bispectrum of the SDSS galaxies yields constraints very similarto those from the power spectrum.

The multiplexing gain definition is shown toaffect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is definedvia the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNRvalues. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used toestimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gaindefinition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) resultsin very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For thisdefinition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number ofantennas and in the multiplexing gain.

While the averageoptimization is less complex than the instantaneous one, its performance isalmost as good at high SNR. A measure of robustness of the optimized algorithmis introduced and evaluated. The optimized algorithm is shown to be robust toperturbations in individual and total transmit powers. Based on the algorithmrobustness, a pre-set power allocation is suggested as a low-complexityalternative to the other optimization strategies, which exhibits only a minorloss in performance over the practical SNR range.",

        "abstract": "The min-sum (MS) algorithm is arguably the second most fundamental algorithmin the realm of message passing due to its optimality (for a tree code) withrespect to the {\\em block error} probability \\cite{Wiberg}. There also seems tobe a fundamental relationship of MS decoding with the linear programmingdecoder \\cite{Koetter}. Despite its importance, its fundamental properties havenot nearly been studied as well as those of the sum-product (also known as BP)algorithm.  We address two questions related to the MS rule. First, we characterize thestability condition under MS decoding. It turns out to be essentially the samecondition as under BP decoding. Second, we perform a degree distributionoptimization. Contrary to the case of BP decoding, under MS decoding thethresholds of the best degree distributions for standard irregular LDPCensembles are significantly bounded away from the Shannon threshold. Moreprecisely, on the AWGN channel, for the best codes that we find, the gap tocapacity is 1dB for a rate 0.3 code and it is 0.4dB when the rate is 0.9 (thegap decreases monotonically as we increase the rate).  We also used the optimization procedure to design codes for modified MSalgorithm where the output of the check node is scaled by a constant$1/\\alpha$. For $\\alpha = 1.25$, we observed that the gap to capacity waslesser for the modified MS algorithm when compared with the MS algorithm.However, it was still quite large, varying from 0.75 dB to 0.2 dB for ratesbetween 0.3 and 0.9.  We conclude by posing what we consider to be the most important openquestions related to the MS algorithm.",

We detected 72sources at 18um in an area of 50.2 arcmin^2 in the AKARI/IRC monitor fieldtowards the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP). From this sample, 25 galaxies withprobable redshifts z>~ 0.5 are selected with a single colour cut (N2-N3>0.1)for a detailed SED analysis with ground-based BVRi'z'JK data. Using an SEDradiative transfer model of starbursts covering the wavelength range UV --submm, we derive photometric redshifts from the optical-MIR SEDs of18um-selected galaxies. From the best-fit SED models, we show that the IRCall-band photometry is capable of tracing the steep rise in flux at the blueside of the PAH 6.2um emission feature. This indicates that the IRC all-bandphotometry is useful to constrain the redshift of infrared galaxies,specifically for dusty galaxies with a less prominent 4000A break. Also, wefind that the flux dip between the PAH 7.7 and 11.2um emission feature isrecognizable in the observed SEDs of galaxies at z~1. By using such a colouranomaly due to the PAH and silicate absorption features, unique samples ofULIRGs at z~1, `silicate-break' galaxies, can be constructed from largecosmological surveys of AKARI towards the NEP, i.e. the NEP-Deep and NEP-Widesurvey. This pilot study suggests the possibility of detecting many interestinggalaxy properties in the NEP-Deep and Wide surveys, such as a systematicdifference in SEDs between high- and low-z ULIRGs, and a large variation of thePAH inter-band strength ratio in galaxies at high redshifts.

No significant spectral evolution is observedfrom this phase to the follow-up phase, and the follow-up phase is usuallyconsistent with the external shock models, implying that this segment likelydue to a refreshed external shock. Within this scenario, the data are generallyconsistent with a roughly constant injection luminosity up to the end of thisphase $t_b$. A positive correlation between E_{iso, X} and t_b also favors thisscenario. Among the 13 bursts that have well-sampled optical light curves, 6have an optical break around t_b and the breaks are consistent with beingachromatic. However, the other 7 bursts either do not show an optical break orhave a break at a different epoch than t_b.

For materials close tothe Mott insulating phase the nuclear spin relaxation rate, the Knight shiftand the Korringa ratio all decrease significantly with decreasing temperaturebelow T_nmr.

The data setcovers 6 wavelength bands from 2.5 to 11 $\\mu$m, with the exposure time of 10 ~20 minutes. This field lies within the CFHT survey with four filter bands ($g',r', i',z'), enabling us to establish nearly continuous spectral energydistributions (SEDs) for wavelengths ranging from 0.4 to 11 $\\mu$m. The mainsample studied here consists of 71 sources whose 11 $\\mu$m AB magnitudes areequal to or brighter than 18.5 (251 $\\mu$Jy), which is complete to more than90%. The 11 $\\mu$m band has an advantage of sampling star forming galaxies withlow to medium redshifts since the prominent PAH feature shifts into this band.As expected, we find that the majority (~68%) of 11 $\\mu$m bright sources arestar forming galaxies at 0.2 < z < 0.7 with $L_{IR} ~ 10^{10}$ -- $10^{12}L_{\\odot}$ based on the detailed modelling of SEDs. We also find four AGNslying at various redshifts in the main sample. In addition, we discuss a fewsources which have non-typical SEDs of the main sample, including a brown dwarfcandidate, a steep power-law source, flat spectrum object, and an early-typegalaxy at moderate redshift.",

We show that the number of particles isconserved for a resonant state, if we use an expanding volume of integration inorder to take account of the outgoing momentum flux; the number of particleswould decay exponentially in a fixed volume of integration. Moreover, weintroduce new numerical methods of treating the resonant state with the use ofthe effective potential. We first give a numerical method of finding aresonance pole in the complex energy plane. The method seeks an energyeigenvalue iteratively. We found that our method leads to a super-convergence,the convergence exponential with respect to the iteration step. The presentmethod is completely independent of commonly used complex scaling. We also givea numerical trick for computing the time evolution of the resonant state in alimited spatial area. Since the wave function of the resonant state isdiverging away from the scattering potential, it has been previously difficultto follow its time evolution numerically in a finite area.",

In addition, the advantage of usingcondition-monitoring data to enhance the predictive capability of these neuralnetworks was also investigated. A number of neural network variations weretrained and tested with the data of two different reliability-related datasets.The first dataset represents the renewal case where the failed unit is repairedand restored to a good-as-new condition. Data was collected in the laboratoryby subjecting a series of similar test pieces to fatigue loading with ahydraulic actuator. The average prediction error of the various neural networksbeing compared varied from 431 to 841 seconds on this dataset, where testpieces had a characteristic life of 8,971 seconds. The second dataset wascollected from a group of pumps used to circulate a water and magnetitesolution within a plant. The data therefore originated from a repaired systemaffected by reliability degradation. When optimized, the multi-layer perceptronneural networks trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the generalregression neural network produced a sum-of-squares error within 11.1% of eachother. The potential for using neural networks for residual life prediction andthe advantage of incorporating condition-based data into the model were provenfor both examples.",

        "abstract": "In order to explore the magnetostrophic regime expected for planetary cores,experiments have been conducted in a rotating sphere filled with liquid sodium,with an imposed dipolar magnetic field (the DTS setup). The field is producedby a permanent magnet enclosed in an inner sphere, which can rotate at aseparate rate, producing a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties areinvestigated by measuring electric potentials on the outer sphere, the inducedmagnetic field in the laboratory frame, and velocity profiles inside the liquidsodium using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. The present article focuses on thetime-averaged axisymmetric part of the flow. The Doppler profiles show that theangular velocity of the fluid is relatively uniform in most of the fluid shell,but rises near the inner sphere, revealing the presence of a magnetic wind, andgently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from a magnetostrophicflow near the inner sphere to a geostrophic flow near the outer sphere iscontrolled by the local Elsasser number. For Rossby numbers up to order 1, theobserved velocity profiles all show a similar shape. Numerical simulations inthe linear regime are computed, and synthetic velocity profiles are comparedwith the measured ones. In the geostrophic region, a torque-balance modelprovides very good predictions. We find that the induced magnetic field variesin a consistent fashion, and displays a peculiar peak in the counter-rotatingregime. This happens when the fluid rotation rate is almost equal and oppositeto the outer sphere rotation rate. The fluid is then almost at rest in thelaboratory frame, and the Proudman-Taylor constraint vanishes, enabling astrong meridional flow. We suggest that dynamo action might be favored in sucha situation.",

PGC 045080 is amoderately distant galaxy having a highly inclined optical disk and massive HIgas content. Radio continuum observations of the galaxy were carried out at 320MHz, 610 MHz and 1.4 GHz. Continuum emission was detected and mapped in thegalaxy. The emission appears extended over the inner disk at all threefrequencies. At 1.4 GHz and 610 MHz it appears to have two distinct lobes. Wealso did optical spectroscopy of the galaxy nucleus; the spectrum did not showany strong emission lines associated with AGN activity but the presence of aweak AGN cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, comparison of the H$\\alpha$ flux andradio continuum at 1.4 GHz suggests that a significant fraction of the emissionis non-thermal in nature. Hence we conclude that a weak or hidden AGN may bepresent in PGC 045080. The extended radio emission represents lobes/jets fromthe AGN. These observations show that although LSB galaxies are metal poor andhave very little star formation, their centers can host significant AGNactivity. We also mapped the HI gas disk and velocity field in PGC 045080. TheHI disk extends well beyond the optical disk and appears warped. In the HIintensity maps, the disk appears distinctly lopsided. The velocity field isdisturbed on the lopsided side of the disk but is fairly uniform in the otherhalf.

Data mining researchhas made much effort to apply various mining algorithms efficiently on largedatabases. However, a serious problem in their practical application is thelong processing time of such algorithms. Nowadays, one of the key challenges isto integrate data mining methods within the framework of traditional databasesystems. Indeed, such implementations can take advantage of the efficiencyprovided by SQL engines. In this paper, we propose an integrating approach fordecision trees within a classical database system. In other words, we try todiscover knowledge from relational databases, in the form of production rules,via a procedure embedding SQL queries. The obtained decision tree is defined bysuccessive, related relational views. Each view corresponds to a givenpopulation in the underlying decision tree. We selected the classical InductionDecision Tree (ID3) algorithm to build the decision tree. To prove that ourimplementation of ID3 works properly, we successfully compared the output ofour procedure with the output of an existing and validated data miningsoftware, SIPINA. Furthermore, since our approach is tuneable, it can begeneralized to any other similar decision tree-based method.",

Methods: A radiative transfer model, including scattering, have been used todecompose each image into a stellar disk, a bulge, and a dust disk. Theparameters describing the distributions have been obtained through standard X^2minimization techniques.  Results: The dust disks fitted to the V-band images are consistent withprevious work in literature: the radial scalelength of dust is larger than thatfor stars (h_d/h_s ~ 1.5); the dust disk has a smaller vertical scalelengththan the stellar (z_d/z_s ~ 1/3); the dust disk is almost transparent when seenface-on (central, face-on, optical depth tau_0 =0.5-1.5). Faster radiativetransfer models which neglect scattering can produce equivalent fits, withchanges in the derived parameters within the accuracy of full fits includingscattering. In the K'-band, no trace is found of a second, massive, dust diskwhich has been invoked to explain observations of dust emission in thesubmillimeter. I discuss the model degeneracies and the effect of complexstructures on the fitted distributions. In particular, most bulges in thesample show a box/peanuts morphology with large residuals; twolower-inclination galaxies show a dust ring distribution, which could be thecause for the large fitted dust scalelengths.",

The soft photon emission is proposed as a mechanismresponsible for the difference between the Rosenbluth, polarization andbeam--target--asymmetry data. It is shown, that the experimentally measuredcross sections depend not only on the Dirac and Pauli form factors, but also onthe average number of the photons emitted.

An indication of the difficulty of theproblem can be garnered from the fact that exponential improvement ofMinkowski's bound has proved to be elusive, even though existing upper boundssuggest that such improvement should be possible.

Thus this is an idealmethod to solve the initial data/constraint equations in General Relativity for(for instance) black hole interactions, or for other strong-field gravitationalconfigurations. Recent efforts have produced finite difference multigridsolvers for domains with holes (excised regions). We present here the extensionof these concepts to higher order (fourth-, sixth- and eigth-order). The highorder convergence allows rapid solution on relatively small computationalgrids. Also, general relativity evolution codes are moving to typicallyfourth-order; data have to be computed at least as accurately as this sameorder for straightfoward demonstration of the proper order of convergence inthe evolution.  Our vertex-centered multigrid code demonstrates globally high-order-accuratesolutions of elliptic equations over domains containing holes, in two spatialdimensions with fixed (Dirichlet) outer boundary conditions, and in threespatial dimensions with {\\it Robin} outer boundary conditions.

        "abstract": "Context. Although Blazars are a small fraction of the overall AGN populationthey are expected to be the dominant population of extragalactic sources in thehard X-ray and gamma-ray bands and have been shown to be the largestcontaminant of CMB fluctuation maps. So far the number of known blazars is ofthe order of several hundreds, but the forthcoming AGILE, GLAST and Planckspace observatories will detect several thousand of objects of this type. Aims.In preparation for these missions it is necessary to identify new samples ofblazars to study their multi-frequency characteristics and statisticalproperties. Methods. We compiled a sample of objects with blazar-likeproperties via a cross-correlation between large radio (NVSS, ATCAPMN) and X-ray surveys (RASS) using the SDSS-DR4 and 2dF survey data to spectroscopicallyidentify our candidates and test the validity of the selection method. Results.We present the Radio - Optical - X-ray catalog built at ASDC (ROXA), a list of816 objects among which 510 are confirmed blazars. Only 19% of the candidatesturned out to be certainly non-blazars demonstrating the high efficiency of ourselection method. Conclusions. Our catalog includes 173 new blazaridentifications, or about 10% of all presently known blazars. The relativelyhigh flux threshold in the X-ray energy band (given by the RASS survey)preferentially selects objects with high fx / fr ratio leading to the discoveryof new High Energy Peaked BL Lac (HBLs). Our catalog therefore includes manynew potential targets for GeV-TeV observations.",

The current $t \\bar t$data from the Tevatron rule out axigluon masses ($m_A$) up to 900 GeV and 850GeV at 2 $\\sigma$ and 4 $\\sigma$ levels respectively. For the case of flavouruniversal colorons the data rule out a mass ($m_C$) below 800 GeV (780 GeV) atthe $2 (4) \\sigma $ level and also the mass range between 900 GeV to 2.1 TeV at2 $\\sigma$ level, for $\\cot \\xi = 1$, where $\\xi$ is the mixing angle.

We also compute the expectedforward-backward asymmetry for the case of the axigluons which would allow itto be discriminated against the SM as also the colorons. We further find thatat the LHC, the signal should be visible in the $t \\bar t$ invariant massspectrum for a wide range of axigluon and coloron masses that are stillallowed. We point out how top polarisation may be used to further discriminatethe axigluon and coloron case from the SM as well as from each other.",

This survey provides a high quality set of spectroscopic data for~6000 galaxies in 48 clusters. A salient feature of this model is thepossibility of treating dust extinction as a function of age, allowing youngerstars to be more obscured than older ones. Our technique, for the first time,takes into account this feature in a spectral fitting code. A set of templatespectra spanning a wide range of star formation histories is built, withfeatures closely resembling those of typical spectra in our sample in terms ofspectral resolution, noise and wavelength coverage. Our method of analyzingthese spectra allows us to test the reliability and the uncertainties relatedto each physical parameter we are inferring. The well-known degeneracy problem,i.e. the non-uniqueness of the best fit solution (mass and extinction indifferent age bins), can be addressed by assigning adequate error bars to therecovered parameters. The values found in this way, together with their errorbars, identify the region of parameter space which contains all the possiblesolutions for a given spectrum. A comparison test was also performed on a WINGSsubsample, containing objects in common with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,yielding excellent agreement. We find that the stellar content as a function ofage is reliably recovered in four main age bins and that the uncertainties onlymildly depend on the S/N ratio. The metallicity of the dominant stellarpopulation is not always recoverable unambiguosly, depending on the StarFormation History pattern.",

The existence ofgravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, howevergravitational waves have not yet been directly observed. One source ofgravitation radiation is binary inspiral. Two compact bodies orbiting eachother, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causestheir orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. Inthis thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for lowmass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the LargeMagellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo maybe in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It hasbeen proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be acomponent of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOswill be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHObinary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitiveband around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds.

LMC and Orion clouds) andGLAST-LAT will detect many more with a higher spatial resolution and in a widerspectral range. We have developed a novel image restoration technique based onthe Richardson-Lucy algorithm optimized for GLAST-LAT observation of extendedsources. Our algorithm calculates PSF (point spread function) for each event.This step is very important for GLAST-LAT and EGRET image analysis since PSFvaries more than one order of magnitude from one gamma ray to another dependingon its energy as well as its impact point and angle in the instrument. TheGLAST-LAT and EGRET image analysis has to cope with Poisson fluctuation due tolow number of detected photons for most sources. Our technique incorporateswavelet filtering to minimize effects due to the fluctuation. Preliminarystudies on some EGRET sources are presented, which shows potential of thisnovel image restoration technique for the identification and characterisationof extended gamma-ray sources.",

The complicated phase structure of the model isstudied thoroughly using numerical tools and analytical arguments. In thethree-dimensional space of coupling parameters we identify the Fermi liquid,the spin gap, the superconductor and the strange metallic phases. The behaviorof three kinds of topological defects -- holon and spinon vortices andmonopoles - is explored in various phases. We also observe a new effect, thestrong enhancement of the phase transition strength reflected in a lower orderof the transition: at sufficiently strong gauge coupling the two second orderphase transitions -- corresponding to spinon-pair and holon condensation lines- join partially in the phase diagram and become a first order phase transitionin that region. The last observation may have an analogue in QuantumChromodynamics at non-zero temperature and finite baryon density.

The strongest effects involving the quasar physicalproperties and BAL properties are related to terminal outflow velocity. Maximumobserved outflow velocities increase with both the bolometric luminosity andthe blueness of the spectral slope, suggesting that the ultraviolet luminosityto a great extent determines the acceleration. These results support the ideaof outflow acceleration via ultraviolet line scattering.",

High-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra have beenobtained in the Be II spectral region near 3130 \\AA for six ultra-Li-deficientstars with the Keck I telescope and its new uv-sensitive CCD on the upgradedHIRES. The spectrum synthesis technique has been used to determine Beabundances. All six stars are found to have Be deficiencies also. Two havemeasurable - but reduced - Be and four have only upper limits on Be. Theseresults are consistent with the idea that these Li- and Be-deficient stars areanalogous to blue stragglers. The stars have undergone mass transfer events (ormergers) which destroy or dilute both Li and Be. The findings cannot be matchedby the models that predict that the deficiencies are due to extra-mixing in asubset of halo stars that were initially rapid rotators, with the possibleexception of one star, G 139-8. Because the ultra-Li-deficient stars are alsoBe-deficient, they appear to be genuine outliers in population of halo starsused to determine the value of primordial Li; they no longer have the Li intheir atmospheres that was produced in the Big Bang.",

In this theory, the graviton becomes massive when general covarianceis spontaneously broken through the introduction of a field that links twometrics, one of the which will eventually decouple. The excitation of this\"link\" field acts like a Goldstone boson in giving mass to the graviton. Wework out the graviton and Goldstone boson propagators explicitly by means ofgauge fixing terms similar to the renormalizability gauges used in gaugetheories. With these propagators, we calculate the lowest order tree-levelinteraction between two external energy momentum tensors. The result isindependent of the gauge parameter, but different from the prediction ofmassless gravity theory, i.e., general relativity. This difference remains evenif the mass of the graviton goes to zero, in which case it gives the vanDam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity between the propagators of a massiveand massless linearized graviton. Moreover, we show that the Fierz-Pauligraviton mass term can be considered as the ``unitary gauge'' of a more generaltheory with an extra scalar field. We explicitly construct such a theory inwhich the vDVZ discontinuity arises with a graviton mass term that is differentfrom the Fierz-Pauli mass term. This theory has a local Weyl symmetry underconformal transformations of the metric. In the case when the mass goes tozero, the Weyl summetry becomes a global symmetry. It is possible that thelocal Weyl symmetry will give a hint as to the form of the corresponding fullynonlinear theory having a nonzero graviton mass.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) degreedistributions, whose decoding threshold on the binary erasure channel (BEC)admits a simple closed form, is presented. These degree distributions are asubset of the check regular distributions (i.e. all the check nodes have thesame degree), and are referred to as $p$-positive distributions. It is givenproof that the threshold for a $p$-positive distribution is simply expressed by$[\\lambda'(0)\\rho'(1)]^{-1}$. Besides this closed form threshold expression,the $p$-positive distributions exhibit three additional properties. First, forgiven code rate, check degree and maximum variable degree, they are in somecases characterized by a threshold which is extremely close to that of the bestknown check regular distributions, under the same set of constraints. Second,the threshold optimization problem within the $p$-positive class can be solvedin some cases with analytic methods, without using any numerical optimizationtool. Third, these distributions can achieve the BEC capacity. The lastproperty is shown by proving that the well-known binomial degree distributionsbelong to the $p$-positive family.",

        "abstract": "A concentration graph associated with a random vector is an undirected graphwhere each vertex corresponds to one random variable in the vector. The absenceof an edge between any pair of vertices (or variables) is equivalent to fullconditional independence between these two variables given all the othervariables. In the multivariate Gaussian case, the absence of an edgecorresponds to a zero coefficient in the precision matrix, which is the inverseof the covariance matrix. It is well known that this concentration graphrepresents some of the conditional independencies in the distribution of theassociated random vector. These conditional independencies correspond to the\"separations\" or absence of edges in that graph. In this paper we assume thatthere are no other independencies present in the probability distribution thanthose represented by the graph. This property is called the perfectMarkovianity of the probability distribution with respect to the associatedconcentration graph. We prove in this paper that this particular concentrationgraph, the one associated with a perfect Markov distribution, can be determinedby only conditioning on a limited number of variables. We demonstrate that thisnumber is equal to the maximum size of the minimal separators in theconcentration graph.",

Moreover, the interaction is assumed to involveonly small transfers of energy and momentum between the two systems (ascompared to typical energies/momenta within the microsystem). The analysis iscarried out within scattering theory. Calculated in the conventional way, thetransition amplitude for the whole system factorizes. The interaction takingplace within the macrosystem is assumed to depend on the stochastic variablesin such a way that, on the average, no particular basis vector state of themicrosystem is favoured. The density matrix is studied in a formalism whichincludes generation of the ingoing state and absorption of the final state.Then the dependence of the final state on the conventional scattering amplitudefor the microsystem is highly non-linear.  In the thermodynamic limit of the macrosystem, the density matrix of theensemble (of microsystem plus macrosystem) develops into a final state whichinvolves a set of macroscopically distinguishable states, each with themicrosystem in one of the basis vector states and the macrosystem in anentangled state.

We determine in this paper the star formationproperties of six additional DLA galaxies. The derived results confirm that nosingle star formation history explains the diverse sets of abundance patternsin DLAs. We demonstrate that the various star formation histories reproducingthe DLA abundance patterns are typical of local irregular, dwarf starburst andquiescent spiral galaxies. Independent of the star formation history, the DLAshave a common characteristic of being weak star forming galaxies; models withhigh star formation efficiencies are ruled out. All the derived DLA starformation rates per unit area are moderate or low, with values between -3.2 <log SFR < -1.1 M_sol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}. The DLA abundance patterns require alarge spread in ages ranging from 20 Myr up to 3 Gyr. The oldest DLA in oursample is observed at z_DLA=1.864 with an age estimated to more than 3 Gyr; itnicely indicates that galaxies were already forming at z_f>10. But, most of theDLAs show ages much younger than that of the Universe at the epoch ofobservation. Young galaxies thus seem to populate the high redshift Universe atz>2, suggesting relatively low redshifts of formation (z~3) for mosthigh-redshift galaxies.

These parameters suggests anage for the system of 1-3 Gyr and a stellar mass of 1.25-1.35 M_sun. This meansthat WASP-1 has properties very similar to those of HD 149026, the host starfor the highest density planet yet detected. Moreover, their planets orbit atcomparable distances and receive comparable irradiating fluxes from their hoststars. However, despite the similarity of WASP-1 with HD 149026, their planetshave strongly different densities. This suggests that gas-giant planet densityis not a simple function of host-star metallicity or of radiation environmentat ages of ~2 Gyr.",

        "abstract": "Searches for the permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) of diamagneticatoms provide powerful probes of CP-violating hadronic and semileptonicinteractions. The theoretical interpretation of such experiments, however,requires careful implementation of a well-known theorem by Schiff that impliesa vanishing net EDM for an atom built entirely from point-like, nonrelativisticconstituents that interact only electrostatically. Any experimental observationof a nonzero atomic EDM would result from corrections to the point-like,nonrelativistic, electrostatic assumption. We reformulate Schiff's theorem atthe operator level and delineate the electronic and nuclear operators whoseatomic matrix elements generate corrections to \"Schiff screening\". We obtain aform for the operator responsible for the leading correction associated withfinite nuclear size -- the so-called \"Schiff moment\" operator -- and observethat it differs from the corresponding operator used in previous Schiff momentcomputations. We show that the more general Schiff moment operator reduces tothe previously employed operator only under certain approximations that are notgenerally justified. We also identify other corrections to Schiff screeningthat may not be included properly in previous theoretical treatments.

The orientation of the disc performs a randomwalk. Deposition of new material promotes SMBH accretion at rates much fasterthan viscous. Observational implications of this picture include: (i) lighteraccretion discs that can fuel AGN and quasars and yet avoid star formation at R>> 0.1 pc; (ii) star formation inside the disc is not a function of massaccretion rate only. It can take place at high or low accretion rates, e.g.,when too few clouds arrive in the inner region. An example of this might be thecentral parsec of our Galaxy. (iii) The discs can form Compton-thick obscuringstructures of ~ parsec size as required in AGN unification models; (iv) fasterblack hole growth resulting from misalignment of the disc and the black holespin in the early Universe; (v) Isotropic deposition of SMBH energy andmomentum feedback in the galaxy bulge.

The BS potential follows from a properansatz on the Wilson loop to encode confinement and is the sum of aone-gluon-exchange and a confinement terms. Besides, the common perturbativestrong coupling is replaced by the ghost-free expression \\alpha_E(Q^2)according to the prescription of Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT). Theagreement of \\alpha_s^{exp}(Q^2) with the APT coupling \\alpha_E(Q^2) turns outto be reasonable from 1 GeV down to the 200 MeV scale, thus confirmingquantitatively the validity of the APT prescription. Below this scale, theexperimental points could give a hint on the vanishing of \\alpha_s(Q^2) as Qapproaches zero. This infrared behaviour would be consistent with some latticeresults and a ``massive'' generalization of the APT approach.

In this case, however, exchangepotentials leading to the HF ground state energy exhibit unphysicaloscillations and do not represent a Kohn-Sham (KS) exchange potential. Thesefindings solve the seemingly paradoxical results of Staroverov, Scuseria andDavidson that certain finite basis set xOEP calculations lead to the HF groundstate energy despite the fact that within a real space (or complete basis)representation the xOEP ground state energy is always higher than the HFenergy. Moreover, whether or not the occupied and unoccupied orbital productsare linearly independent, it is shown that basis set xOEP methods onlyrepresent exact exchange-only (EXX) KS methods, i.e., proper density-functionalmethods, if the orbital basis set and the auxiliary basis set representing theexchange potential are balanced to each other, i.e., if the orbital basis iscomprehensive enough for a given auxiliary basis.

The lens reconstruction of the UV morphology of the LBGindicates that it comprises two components separated by ~2 kpc. The CO emissionis unresolved, and appears to be centered on the intrinsically fainter (andalso less highly magnified) of the two UV components. The width of the CO lineindicates a dynamical mass of (8+/-2)x10^9csc(i)^2 Mo within the central 2 kpc.Employing mid-infrared observations from Spitzer we derive a stellar mass of~(6+/-2)x10^9 Mo and a star-formation rate of ~60 Mo/yr, indicating that themolecular gas will be consumed in ~40 Myr.

Although f_b is lower thanthe WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observationalsystematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that ispredicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence forundetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance withcluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion ofthe contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increasein X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted forby a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument thatthe behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by adecrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within justthe stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCGand ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICLcomponent, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficientlyin higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from oursample selection, which favored systems with central, giant ellipticalgalaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of lowmass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation ofintracluster stars does not require a massive cluster environment.

        "abstract": "We model the interaction between the wind from a newly formed rapidlyrotating magnetar and the surrounding supernova shock and host star. Thedynamics is modeled using the two-dimensional, axisymmetric thin-shellequations. In the first ~10-100 seconds after core collapse the magnetarinflates a bubble of plasma and magnetic fields behind the supernova shock. Thebubble expands asymmetrically because of the pinching effect of the toroidalmagnetic field, just as in the analogous problem of the evolution of pulsarwind nebulae. The degree of asymmetry depends on E_mag/E_tot. The correct valueof E_mag/E_tot is uncertain because of uncertainties in the conversion ofmagnetic energy into kinetic energy at large radii in relativistic winds; weargue, however, that bubbles inflated by newly formed magnetars are likely tobe significantly more magnetized than their pulsar counterparts. We show thatfor a ratio of magnetic to total power supplied by the central magnetarL_mag/L_tot ~ 0.1 the bubble expands relatively spherically. For L_mag/L_tot ~0.3, however, most of the pressure in the bubble is exerted close to therotation axis, driving a collimated outflow out through the host star. This canaccount for the collimation inferred from observations of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Outflows from magnetars become increasinglymagnetically dominated at late times, due to the decrease in neutrino-drivenmass loss as the young neutron star cools. We thus suggest that themagnetar-driven bubble initially expands relatively spherically, enhancing theenergy of the associated supernova, while at late times it becomesprogressively more collimated, producing the GRB.",

We analyse the stability of the Einstein clusters againstboth radial and non-radial pulsations, and we show that the Einstein clustersare dynamically stable. With the use of the Buchdahl type inequalities foranisotropic bodies, we derive upper limits on the velocity of the particlesdefining the cluster. These limits are consistent with those obtained fromstability considerations. The study of light deflection shows that thegravitational lensing effect is slightly smaller for the Einstein clusters, ascompared to the singular isothermal density sphere model for dark matter.Therefore lensing observations may discriminate, at least in principle, betweenEinstein cluster and other dark matter models.",

This paperreports the performances of the charge injection capability based on the groundexperiments using a radiation damaged device, and in-orbit measurements of theXIS. The ground experiments show that charges are stably injected with thedispersion of 91eV in FWHM in a specific column for the charges equivalent tothe X-ray energy of 5.1keV. This dispersion width is significantly smaller thanthat of the X-ray events of 113eV (FWHM) at approximately the same energy. Theamount of charge loss during transfer in a specific column, which is measuredwith the charge injection capability, is consistent with that measured with thecalibration source. These results indicate that the charge injection techniquecan accurately measure column-dependent charge losses rather than thecalibration sources. The column-to-column CTI correction to the calibrationsource spectra significantly reduces the line widths compared to those with acolumn-averaged CTI correction (from 193eV to 173eV in FWHM on an average atthe time of one year after the launch).

It is however well known that the dynamics of themagnetic field is linked to that of the velocity field in the core and anyattempt to model secular variations will involve a coupled dynamical system formagnetic field and core velocity. Unfortunately, there is no direct observationof the velocity. Independently of the exact nature of the above-mentionedcoupled system -- some version being currently under construction -- thequestion is debated in this paper whether good knowledge of the magnetic fieldcan be translated into good knowledge of core dynamics. Furthermore, what willbe the impact of the most recent and precise geomagnetic data on our knowledgeof the geomagnetic field of the past and future? These questions are cast intothe language of variational data assimilation, while the dynamical systemconsidered in this paper consists in a set of two oversimplifiedone-dimensional equations for magnetic and velocity fields. This toy modelretains important features inherited from the induction and Navier-Stokesequations: non-linear magnetic and momentum terms are present and its linearresponse to small disturbances contains Alfv\\'en waves.

In 2006, thedetector was approximately 10% completed, and we report on data acquired fromthe detector in this configuration. We observe an atmospheric neutrino signalconsistent with expectations, demonstrating that the IceCube detector iscapable of identifying neutrino events.

The method automaticallydetermines both the Weyl chamber steering trajectory and the accompanying localrotations. Particular attention is paid to the case of anisotropic exchangewith tracking controls, which is solved analytically. It is shown that, ifcomputational subspace is well isolated, any exchange interaction can alwaysgenerate high-fidelity, single-step controlled-NOT (CNOT) logic, provided thatboth qubits can be individually manipulated. The results are then applied tosuperconducting qubit architectures, for which several CNOT gateimplementations are identified.

Focusing on multiple-accessnetworks, it is demonstrated that game theory can be used as an effective toolto study resource allocation in wireless networks with quality-of-service (QoS)constraints. A family of non-cooperative (distributed) games is presented inwhich each user seeks to choose a strategy that maximizes its own utility whilesatisfying its QoS requirements. The utility function considered here measuresthe number of reliable bits that are transmitted per joule of energy consumedand, hence, is particulary suitable for energy-constrained networks. Theactions available to each user in trying to maximize its own utility are atleast the choice of the transmit power and, depending on the situation, theuser may also be able to choose its transmission rate, modulation, packet size,multiuser receiver, multi-antenna processing algorithm, or carrier allocationstrategy. The best-response strategy and Nash equilibrium for each game ispresented. Using this game-theoretic framework, the effects of power control,rate control, modulation, temporal and spatial signal processing, carrierallocation strategy and delay QoS constraints on energy efficiency and networkcapacity are quantified.",

The line isthought to be produced by iron fluorescence of a relatively cold X-rayilluminated material in the innermost parts of the accretion disc and providesan excellent diagnostic of accretion flows in the vicinity of black holes.Previous studies have concentrated on the case of a thin, Keplerian accretiondisc. This disc must become thicker and sub-Keplerian with increasing accretionrates. These can affect the line profiles and in turn can influence theestimation of the accretion disc and black hole parameters from the observedline profiles. We here embark on, for the first time, a fully relativisticcomputation which offers key insights into the effects of geometrical thicknessand the sub-Keplerian orbital velocity on the line profiles. We include allrelativistic effects such as frame-dragging, Doppler boost, time dilation,gravitational redshift and light bending. We find that the separation and therelative height between the blue and red peaks of the line profile diminish asthe thickness of the disc increases. This code is also well-suited to produceaccretion disc images. We calculate the redshift and flux images of theaccretion disc and find that the observed image of the disc strongly depends onthe inclination angle. The self-shadowing effect appears remarkable for a highinclination angle, and leads to the black hole shadow being completely hiddenby the disc itself.",

Since theconformational behaviour of flexible molecules is nothing more than a complexphysical problem, increasingly more physicists are moving into the study ofprotein systems, bringing with them powerful mathematical and computationaltools, as well as the sharp intuition and deep images inherent to the physicsdiscipline. This work attempts to facilitate the first steps of such atransition. In order to achieve this goal, we provide an exhaustive account ofthe reasons underlying the protein folding problem enormous relevance andsummarize the present-day status of the methods aimed to solving it. We alsoprovide an introduction to the particular structure of these biologicalheteropolymers, and we physically define the problem stating the assumptionsbehind this (commonly implicit) definition. Finally, we review the 'specialflavor' of statistical mechanics that is typically used to study theastronomically large phase spaces of macromolecules.

Itsbasic structure can be interpreted in terms of a magnetic flux sheet or tubethat vertically extends through the ambient weak-field or field-free atmospherewith which it is in mechanical equilibrium. A more refined interpretation comesfrom new three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations that are capable ofreproducing the corrugated shape of magnetic flux concentrations and theirsignature in the visible continuum. Furthermore it is shown that thecharacteristic asymmetric shape of the contrast profile of facular granules isan effect of radiative transfer across the rarefied atmosphere of the magneticflux concentration. I also discuss three-dimensional radiationmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of the integral layers from the top of theconvection zone to the mid-chromosphere. They show a highly dynamicchromospheric magnetic field, marked by rapidly moving filaments of strongerthan average magnetic field that form in the compression zone downstream andalong propagating shock fronts. The simulations confirm the picture of fluxconcentrations that strongly expand through the photosphere into a morehomogeneous, space filling chromospheric field.

We have obtained high-cadence radial velocity measurementsspanning 1.3 years of HD 33636 with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at McDonaldObservatory. We combined these data with previously published velocities tocreate a data set that spans nine years. We used this data set to search for,and place mass limits on, the existence of additional companions in the HD33636 system. Our high-precision astrometric observations of the system withthe HST Fine Guidance Sensor 1r span 1.2 years. We simultaneously modeled theradial velocity and astrometry data to determine the parallax, proper motion,and perturbation orbit parameters of HD 33636. Our derived parallax, pi = 35.6+/- 0.2 mas, agrees within the uncertainties with the Hipparcos value.

The sample was observed withmedium-resolution, optical spectroscopy and contains some galaxies withunpublished velocity dispersion measurements and emission-line fluxes. Measuredvelocity dispersions are 130-340 km/s with a mean of 216 km/s. Converting to BHmass, we find that the BH mass distribution is identical for FRIs and FRIIs,with a mean of approximately 2.5x10^8 Msun. We convert [OII] and [OIII]emission-line luminosities to photoionizing luminosity under the assumptionthat the gas is ionized by the nuclear UV continuum. Most of the galaxies withFRI morphology and/or low-excitation emission-line spectra have progressivelylower BH masses at lower photoionizing (and jet) luminosities. This agrees withthe Ledlow-Owen relation which states that the radio luminosity at the FRI/FRIItransition depends on the optical luminosity of the host, L_radio ~L_optical^1.8, because both L_radio and L_optical relate to AGN nuclearparameters. When recasting the Ledlow-Owen relation into BH mass versusphotoionizing and jet luminosity, we find that the recasted relation describesthe sample quite well. The FRI/FRII transition occurs at approximately an orderof magnitude lower luminosity relative to the Eddington luminosity than thesoft-to-hard transition in X-ray binaries. This difference is consistent withthe Ledlow-Owen relation, which predicts a weak BH mass dependence in thetransition luminosity. We conclude that the FRI/FRII dichotomy is caused by acombination of external and nuclear factors, with the latter dominating.",

        "abstract": "[Abridged] We have been exploring a spectroscopic unification for all knowntypes of broad line emitting AGN. The 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) parameter spaceshows promise as a unification capable of organizing quasar diversity on asequence primarily governed by Eddington ratio. This paper considers the roleof CIV 1549 measures with special emphasis on the CIV 1549 line shift as aprincipal 4DE1 diagnostic. We use HST archival spectra for 130 sources with S/Nhigh enough to permit reliable CIV 1549 broad component (BC) measures. We finda CIV 1549 BC profile blueshift that is strongly concentrated among (largelyradio-quiet: RQ) sources with FWHM(H beta BC) < 4000 km/s (which we callPopulation A). Narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1, with FWHM H beta < 2000 km/s)sources belong to this population but do not emerge as a distinct class. Thesystematic blueshift, widely interpreted as arising in a disk wind/outflow, isnot observed in broader lined AGN which we call Population B. We find newcorrelations between FWHM(CIV 1549 BC) and CIV 1549 line shift as well as theequivalent width of CIV 1549. They are seen only in Pop. A sources. CIV 1549measures enhance the apparent dichotomy at FWHM(Hbeta BC) approx. 4000 \\kms\\(Sulentic et al. 2000) suggesting that it has more significance in the contextof Broad Line Region structure than the more commonly discussed RL vs. RQdichotomy. Black hole masses computed from FWHM CIV 1549 BC for about 80 AGNindicate that the CIV 1549 width is a poor virial estimator. Comparison of massestimates derived from Hbeta BC and CIV 1549 reveals that the latter showdifferent and nonlinear offsets for population A and B sources. A significantnumber of sources also show narrow line CIV 1549 emission. We present a recipefor CIV 1549 narrow component extraction.",

We use the Hall induction equation in axial symmetry to obtain somegeneral properties of nonevolving fields, as well as analyzing the evolution ofpurely toroidal fields, their poloidal perturbations, and current-free, purelypoloidal fields. We also analyze energy conservation in Hall instabilities andwrite down a variational principle for Hall equilibria. We show that theevolution of any toroidal magnetic field can be described by Burgers' equation,as previously found in plane-parallel geometry. It leads to sharp currentsheets that dissipate on the Hall time scale, yielding a stationary fieldconfiguration that depends on a single, suitably defined coordinate. Thisfield, however, is unstable to poloidal perturbations, which grow as theirfield lines are stretched by the background electron flow, as in instabilitiesearlier found numerically. On the other hand, current-free poloidalconfigurations are stable and could represent a long-lived crustal fieldsupported by currents in the fluid stellar core.",

Thecorresponding required rate of growth of K as a function of M is found to besufficient to also make the individual source-destination fading links convergeto nonfading links.

The 4D laws of gravity are obtained on a braneembedded in an infinite volume extra space, where the problem of stabilizationof the volume modulus is absent.

Theconventional branch gives a perturbatively stable model of a metastablegraviton, with potentially testable predictions within the Solar system. Theself-accelerated branch, on the other hand, provides an existence proof for anidea that the accelerated expansion of the Universe could be due to modifiedgravity. The issue of perturbative stability of the self-accelerated branch isobscured by a breakdown of the conventional perturbative expansion. However, acertain exact non-perturbative solution found in hep-th/0612016 exhibits a netnegative gravitational mass, while this mass is positive on the conventionalbranch. This suggest that the self-accelerated solution must benon-perturbatively unstable.

Next we consider the recurrent models of $^3$He defined on thesquare, Husimi and hexagon lattices.

We investigate this problem in amodel-independent way by following quintessence field trajectories in `energy'phase-space. Attractor dynamics in this phase-space leads to two classes ofacceptable models: 1) models with flat potentials, i.e. an effectivecosmological constant, and 2) models with potentials that suddenly flatten witha characteristic kink. The prospect of further constraining the second class ofmodels from distance measurements and fluctuation growth rates at low redshift(z<3) seems poor. However, in some models of this second class, the dark energymakes a significant contribution to the total energy density at high redshift.Such models can be further constrained from observation of the cosmic microwavebackground anisotropies and from primordial nucleosynthesis. It is possible,therefore, to construct models in which the dark energy at high redshift causesobservable effects, even if future dark energy surveys constrain w at lowredshift to be consistent with -1 to high precision.",

The gauge invariance of Yang-Mills quantummechanics is reinterpreted as a quantum-statistical symmetry, which is takeninto account by setting up a novel algebraic and projective structure in theformalism. Ordinary physical observables of Yang-Mills theory, obeying thestandard algebra, are expressed as bilinear forms of the D-particle fields.Together with the open-closed string duality, our new formulation suggests atrinity of three different but mutually dual viewpoints in string theory.",

However, a brief oxygenplasma etch allows full recovery of the insulating character of the substrate.The I-V characteristics of the bridges are then fully linear over a large rangeof current densities. We find colossal magnetoresistance properties typical forstrained LCMO on STO but no signature of non-linear effects (so-calledelectroresistance) connected to electronic inhomogeneites.

The exceptions are: 1) theU-B colour, where the models are typically redder than the observations, and;2) the very cool stars in general (V-K > ~3).Concerning the high resolutionfeatures, we measured 35 spectral indices defined in the literature on threehigh resolution synthetic libraries (Coelho et al. 2005; Martins et al. 2005;Munari et al. 2005), and compared them with the observed measurements given bythree empirical libraries (Valdes et al.2004; Sanchez-Blazquez et al. 2006;Prugniel & Soubiran 2001).

It is unlikely that the uniformity of metallicity upto the virial radii is due to mixing caused by a cluster collision. Since theram-pressure is too small to strip the interstellar medium of galaxies aroundthe virial radius of a cluster, the fairly high metallicity that we found thereindicates that the metals in the ICM are not transported from member galaxiesby ram-pressure stripping. Instead, the uniformity suggests that theproto-cluster region was extensively polluted with metals by extremely powerfuloutflows (superwinds) from galaxies before the clusters formed.

This ULIRG population has similarities with high-zradio-galaxy hosts. No number density evolution is included. The Herschelobservatory will hopefully confirm these results.",

Using the model obtained we have then run the simulations for theinfected memory T cells, called also latent T cells, which, at the moment,represent the major obstacle to finding a cure for HIV. We can now report thatthe infected latent T cells have an estimated lifetime of about 42 hours fromthe moment they are re-activated. As far as we know this is the first result ofthis type obtained for the infected memory T cells.",

Thesesystems have been chosen because they provide access to a regime of red-shiftspace that previous weak MgII studies have not looked at. The densities,metallicities, Doppler parameters, and column densities of these systems arecompared to those of other weak MgII systems at lower redshift. There is nosignificant statistical variation in the properties of the absorbers over theredshift range 0.4<z<2.4. The number density per unit redshift is known todecrease for weak MgII absorbers between z~1 and z~2 by a greater amount thanpredicted from cosmological effects and changes in the extragalactic ionizingbackground alone. We suggest that, because the physical properties of theabsorber population are not seen to change significantly across this range,that the evolution in dN/dz is due to a decrease in the activity that givesrise to weak MgII absorption, and not due to a change in the processes thatform weak MgII absorbers. The presence of separate, but aligned (in velocity)low and high density clouds in all single cloud weak MgII absorbers provides animportant diagnostic of their geometry. We discuss possible origins in dwarfgalaxies and in extragalactic analogs to high velocity clouds.",

        "abstract": "We present a study of the shapes, orientations, and alignments of Galacticdark matter subhalos in the ``Via Lactea'' simulation of a Milky Way-size LCDMhost halo. Whereas isolated dark matter halos tend to be prolate, subhalos arepredominantly triaxial. Overall subhalos are more spherical than the host halo,with minor to major and intermediate to major axis ratios of 0.68 and 0.83,respectively. Like isolated halos, subhalos tend to be less spherical in theircentral regions. The principal axis ratios are independent of subhalo mass,when the shapes are measured within a physical scale like r_Vmax, the radius ofthe peak of the circular velocity curve. Subhalos tend to be slightly morespherical closer to the host halo center. The spatial distribution of thesubhalos traces the prolate shape of the host halo when they are selected bythe largest V_max they ever had, i.e. before they experienced strong tidal massloss. The subhalos' orientation is not random: the major axis tends to alignwith the direction towards the host halo center. This alignment disappears forhalos beyond 3 r_200 and is more pronounced when the shapes are measured in theouter regions of the subhalos. The radial alignment is preserved during asubhalo's orbit and they become elongated during pericenter passage, indicatingthat the alignment is likely caused by the host halo's tidal forces. Thesetidal interactions with the host halo act to make subhalos rounder over time.",

We combine cluster ages and metallicities with the work ofGrocholski & Sarajedini to predict each cluster's absolute K-band red clumpmagnitude, and thereby calculate absolute cluster distances. An analysis ofthese data shows that the cluster distribution is in good agreement with thethick, inclined disk geometry of the LMC, as defined by its field stars.

It isfound that the BPJ shock may either converge to the symmetry axis or divergeaway from it, depending on the opening angle of the BPJ injection cone.

There are a number of alternate characterizations:the operator of multiplication by $S$ defines a contraction operator betweentwo Hardy Hilbert spaces, $S$ satisfies a von Neumann inequality, a certainoperator-valued kernel associated with $S$ is positive-definite, and $S$ can berealized as the transfer function of a dissipative (or even conservative)discrete-time linear input/state/output linear system. Various multivariablegeneralizations of this class have appeared recently,one of the mostencompassing being that of Muhly and Solel where the unit disk is replaced bythe strict unit ball of the elements of a dual correspondence $E^{\\sigma}$associated with a $W^{*}$-correspondence $E$ over a $W^{*}$-algebra $\\cA$together with a $*$-representation $\\sigma$ of $\\cA$. The main new point whichwe add here is the introduction of the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbertcorrespondence and identification of the Muhly-Solel Hardy spaces asreproducing kernel Hilbert correspondences associated with a completelypositive analogue of the classical Szeg\\\"o kernel. In this way we are able tomake the analogy between the Muhly-Solel Schur class and the classical Schurclass more complete.

Inthis paper the world-line quantum Monte Carlo method is used to study spin,charge, and bond order correlations of the one-dimensional extended Hubbardmodel in the presence of coupling to the lattice. A static alternating latticedistortion (the ionic Hubbard model) leads to enhanced charge density wavecorrelations at the expense of antiferromagnetic order. When the latticedegrees of freedom are dynamic (the Hubbard-Holstein model), we show that asimilar effect occurs even though the charge asymmetry must arisespontaneously. Although the evolution of the total energy with lattice couplingis smooth, the individual components exhibit sharp crossovers at the phaseboundaries. Finally, we observe a tendency for bond order in the region betweenthe charge and spin density wave phases.",

Differently from the coordinateBethe ansatz, where the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are plane wavecombinations, in this ansatz the components of the eigenfunctions are obtainedthrough the algebraic properties of properly defined matrices. In this work, weintroduce a formulation of a matrix product ansatz for the six-vertex modelwith periodic boundary condition, which is the paradigmatic example ofintegrability in two dimensions. Remarkably, our studies of the six-vertexmodel are in agreement with the conjecture that all models exactly solved bythe Bethe ansatz can also be solved by an appropriated matrix product ansatz.",

It respects the analog of the Birkhoff theorem, i.e., thevacuum spherically symmetric solution is necessarily static. As in generalrelativity, the spherically symmetric solution is seen to describe a blackhole. The exterior geometry is essentially the same as in the Schwarzschildcase, with power-law corrections to the Newtonian potential. The behaviorinside the black-hole region is different from the Schwarzschild case in thatthe usual spacetime singularity gets replaced by a singular surface of a newtype, where all basic fields of the theory remain finite but metric ceases toexist. The theory does not admit arbitrarily small black holes: for smallobjects, the curvature on the would-be horizon is so strong that non-metricmodifications prevent the horizon from being formed. The theory allows formodifications of gravity of very interesting nature. We discuss three physicaleffects, namely, (i) correction to Newton's law in the neighborhood of thesource, (ii) renormalization of effective gravitational and cosmologicalconstants at large distances from the source, and (iii) additional redshiftfactor between spatial regions of different curvature. The first two effectscan be responsible, respectively, for the observed anomaly in the accelerationof the Pioneer spacecraft and for the alleged missing mass in spiral galaxiesand other astrophysical objects. The third effect can be used to propose anon-cosmological explanation of high redshifts of quasars and gamma-ray bursts.",

At T=660K the free energy becomes a monotonicallydecreasing function of the order parameter as the liquid phase becomesunstable, indicating we have reached a spinodal. In contrast to the usualmean-field theory predictions, the size of the critical embryo remains finiteas the spinodal is approached. We also calculate the rate of nucleation,independently from our free energy calculations, and observe a rapid increasein its temperature dependence when the free energy barrier is in the order of$kT$.
